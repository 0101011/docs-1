Copy Databases Between ``mongod`` Instances
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

If you need to copy data between two MongoDB instances, you may
consider using the :dbcommand:`copydb` and :dbcommand:`clone`
commands. Both commands copy a :term:`database` from one MongoDB
instance to another without the use of intermediate files, and are
also useful for renaming a database within a single MongoDB
instance. Additional use cases include data migrations and data
warehousing, seeding test environments, and as a component of a larger
backup strategy. The :program:`mongo` shell also provides the
:method:`db.cloneDatabase()` and :method:`db.copyDatabase()` helpers as
wrappers around these commands.

In some situations you may prefer :dbcommand:`copydb` and
:dbcommand:`clone` over :program:`mongodump` and
:program:`mongorestore`, which have similar use profiles, but require
intermediate files and additional tooling.

This document oulines the procedure to copy MongoDB databases using
the :dbcommand:`copydb` and :dbcommand:`clone` commands.

.. note::

   :dbcommand:`copydb` and :dbcommand:`clone` do not produce
   point-in-time snapshots of the source database. Write traffic to
   the source or destination database during the copy process may
   result in databases with different contents.

Considerations
--------------

- You must run :dbcommand:`copydb` or :dbcommand:`clone` on the
  destination server.

- You can use :dbcommand:`copydb` or :dbcommand:`clone` with unsharded
  databases in a :term:`shard cluster` when you're connected directly
  to the :program:`mongod` instance.

- You can run :dbcommand:`copydb` or :dbcommand:`clone` commands on a
  :term:`secondary` member of a replica set, with properly configured
  :term:`read preference`.

- There must be enough free disk space on the destination server for
  the database you are copying. Use the :method:`db.stats()` operation
  to check the size of the database on the source :program:`mongod`
  instance. For more information on the output of :method:`db.stats()` see
  :doc:`/reference/database-statistics` document.

Processes
---------

Copy and Rename a Database to another ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To transfer a database from one MongoDB instance to another, use the
:dbcommand:`copydb` command, or the :method:`db.copyDatabase()` helper
in the :program:`mongo` shell. Possible uses include instance seeding
a development environment and establishing a testing system.

Copy the database named ``test`` on server ``db0.example.net`` to
the server named ``db1.example.net`` and rename it to ``records``
using the following procedure:

- Verify that the database, ``test`` exists on the source
  :program:`mongod` instance running on the ``db0.example.net`` host.

- Connect to the destination server, running on the
  ``db1.example.net`` host, using the :program:`mongo` shell.

- Issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.copyDatabase( "test", "records", db0.example.net )

Rename a Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To copy a database within the same server also renaming the database,
use the :dbcommand:`copydb` command, or the :method:`db.copyDatabase()`
helper in the :program:`mongo` shell. You may use this to correct a
misnamed database or to support a testing process.

Rename a database from ``test`` to ``records`` on the a
:program:`mongod` instance using the following procedure:

- Connect to the :program:`mongod` using the :program:`mongo` shell.

- Issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.copyDatabase( "test", "records" )

Copy a Database with Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the source server has :setting:`auth` enabled, and you want to copy
a database from this instance, you can include these parameters in the
:dbcommand:`copydb` command, or as arguments to the
:method:`db.copyDatabase()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell.

Copy ``test`` to ``records`` from the :program:`mongod` running on
``db0.example.net``, which requires authentication for all
connections, to the :program:`mongod` instance running on
``db1.example.net`` using the following procedure:

- Connect to the destination :program:`mongod` instance running on the
  ``db1.example.net`` host using the :program:`mongo` shell.

- Issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.copyDatabase( "test", "records", db0.example.net, "username", "password")

Clone a Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`clone` command copies a database between
:program:`mongod` instances; however, :dbcommand:`clone` preserves the
database name on the destination server. For many operations,
:dbcommand:`clone` has identical functionality and a simpler syntax
than :dbcommand:`copydb`. The :method:`db.cloneDatabase()` helper in the
:program:`mongo` shell provides a wrapper around :dbcommand:`clone`.

Clone a database from `the :program:`mongod` running on
`db0.example.net`` to the :program:`mongod` running on
``db1.example.net`` using the following procedure:

- Connect to the destination :program:`mongod` instance running on the
  ``db1.example.net`` host using the :program:`mongo` shell.

- Issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.cloneDatabase( "db0.example.net" )
