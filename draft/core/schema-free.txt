MongoDB has :term:`databases <database>`, :term:`collections
<collection>`, and :term:`indexes <index>` much like a traditional
RDBMS. In some cases (databases and collections), these can be
implicitly created. Once created, they exist in a system catalog
(for example, ``db.systems.collections``, ``db.system.indexes``).

Collections contain :term:`BSON` :term:`documents <document>`. Within
these documents are fields. In MongoDB there is no predefinition of
fields (what would be columns in an RDBMS). There is no schema for
fields within documents. The fields and their value datatypes can vary.
Thus there is no notion of an "alter table" operation that adds a
"column".

In practice, it is highly common for a collection to have a homogenous
structure across documents. Hoowever this is not a requirement. This
flexibility means that schema migration and augmentation are very easy
in practice. Rarely will you need to write scripts that perform "alter
table" type operations. In addition to making schema migration flexible,
this facility makes iterative software development atop the database
easier.
