Operations
----------

The :doc:`/crud` section of this manual contains specific
documentation for the major classes of write operations for MongoDB
databases. Read the following pages for additional examples and
documentation:

:doc:`/applications/create`
:doc:`/applications/delete`
:doc:`/applications/update`

Also consider the following methods in the :program:`mongo` JavaScript
shell that allow you to write or change data in a MongoDB database.

- :method:`db.collection.insert()`
- :method:`db.collection.update()`
- :method:`db.collection.save()`
- :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`
- :method:`db.collection.remove()`
- :method:`db.collection.delete()`

Consider the documentation for your client library or :doc:`driver
</applications/drivers>` for more information on how to access this
functionality from within your application.
