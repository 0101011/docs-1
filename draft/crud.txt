CRUD and Database Operations
============================

.. These documents and this section will likely end up as part of the
   applications section (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/)
   but having a separate/orphan page might be useful.

CRUD stands for :term:`create`, :term:`read`, :term:`update`, and
:term:`delete` that form the core of most database driven
applications. In MongoDB most applications interact with the database
by way of a client library or :term:`driver` that provides an
idiomatic interface to MongoDB for developers in the programming
language of their choice. These documents approach CRUD from a very
high level: the :doc:`/core/read-operations` document introduces
reading from the database and related operations including
aggregation, while the :doc:`/core/write-operations` document
introduces a collection of insertion, updating, and deletion
operations.
