CRUD and Database Operations
============================

.. These documents and this section will likely end up as part of the
   applications section (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/)
   but having a separate/orphan page might be useful.

CRUD stands for :term:`create`, :term:`read`, :term:`update`, and
:term:`delete`, which are the four core database operations, used in
database driven application development.
