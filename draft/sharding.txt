MongoDB provides an automatic sharding features so that you may
distribute a single database across a cluster of machines. MongoDB
uses range-based portioning to distribute :term:`documents <document>`
between members of a shard cluster based on a specific ":term:`shard key`.

For a high-level introduction to the underlying concepts and operation
of sharding, consider ":doc:`/core/sharding`." Once you understand how
sharding works and you decide to use sharding in your deployment, the
":doc:`/administration/sharding-architectures`" document provides an
overview of basic system architectures.

Administrators of shard clusters should consider the
":doc:`/administration/sharding`" document. This resource contains a
catalog of procedures for configuring and maintaining shard clusters,
in addition to a :ref:`troubleshooting <sharding-troubleshooting>`
section to aid in diagnosing common issues with sharding. Use the
:ref:`sharding tutorials <sharding-tutorials>` for instructions on
complete administrative operations.

Finally, if you're interested in learning more about the internal
operation of sharding, the ":doc:`/core/sharding-internals`" document
provides a more detailed explanation of how MongoDB implements
sharding.
