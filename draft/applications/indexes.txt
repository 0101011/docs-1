Using Indexes

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

MongoDB supports :doc:`indexes </core/indexes>` that allow the
database to return results quickly while requiring that the database
scan a minimal number of documents. This can reduce disk access, and
help maintain more even performance in general. See the
":doc:`/core/indexes`" document for more information on the types of
indexes supported by MongoDB and a general background on the index
functionality. Also consider the ":doc:`/administration/indexing`"
document for an introduction to index related operations.

This document provides an overview of the approaches to indexing and
the strategies that you can use as you develop applications with
MongoDB.

Strategies
----------

Use Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sort Using Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Store Indexes in RAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. check the size of the index in ram.

   consider the size of the working set.

Considerations
--------------

Selectivity
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ensure the index is selective enough to be able to constrain the
   match productively.

Insert Throughput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. inserts

Storage
~~~~~~~

.. considerations include:
   - size of the index
   - left/right hand hotness
   - DOCS-224

System
~~~~~~

.. considerations include:
   - number of indexs
   - indexed key limitations
   - one query per index.
