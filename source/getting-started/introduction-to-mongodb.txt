Welcome to MongoDB. This guide is intended to provide a quick introduction to
MongoDB. We will introduce major concepts and walk you through the process of
installing and using MongoDB.

What is MongoDB
---------------

MongoDB is an open source document database that provides high performance,
high availability, and easy scalability. The following four features are unique
to MongoDB.

Document Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Documents (objects) map nicely to programming language data types.
- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for joins.
- Dynamic schema makes polymorphism easier.

High Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Embedding reduces io on server
- Indexes can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.
- Optional streaming writes (no acknowledgments).

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Replicated servers with automatic master failover.

Easy Scalability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Automatic sharding distributes collection data across machines.
- Eventually-consistent reads can be distributed over replicated servers.
