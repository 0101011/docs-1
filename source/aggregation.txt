Aggregations are operations that process a number of data records and
return a computed result. Aggregation operations group values from
multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations 
on the grouped data to return a single result. MongoDB provides
three ways to perform aggregation: the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the :doc:`map-reduce function
</core/map-reduce>`, and :doc:`single purpose aggregation methods and
commands </core/single-purpose-aggregation>`.
