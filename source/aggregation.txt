.. default-domain:: mongodb

Aggregation groups values of multiple documents together as input to a
specified set of operations that return single result. MongoDB provides
three ways to perform aggregation: the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the :doc:`map-reduce function
</core/map-reduce>`, and :doc:`simple aggregation methods and commands
</reference/simple-aggregation>`.
