Aggregations operations process data records and return computed
results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents
together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data
to return a single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform
aggregation: the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the :doc:`map-reduce function
</core/map-reduce>`, and :doc:`single purpose aggregation methods and
commands </core/single-purpose-aggregation>`.
