**Replication in MongoDB**

   Replica Sets provide Replication in MongoDB. In a replica set
   write operations are performed on a single server called a *primary*.
   These operations are then re-applied on other servers know as
   *secondaries*.  Each replica set has a minimum of three members a
   :term:`primary` and one or more :term:`secondaries <secondary>`.

   While all members can accept read operations, only the primary can
   accept write operations. Writing to a single instance ensures that
   no operations conflict, which provides strict consistency among
   members. Secondaries replicate operations asynchronously which permits
   replication to continue even if some members are unavailable. As a
   result, secondaries do not always have the latest operations.

   For more information, see :doc:`/faq/replica-sets`, :doc:`/core/replica-set-members`, and
   :doc:`/core/replication-process`.

**High Availability and Replica Sets**

   Replica sets provide automatic failover and recovery to support
   autonomous operation. If the primary of a set becomes unavailable,
   the set will elect one of the secondaries to act as primary.

   Given automatic failover, applications do not need to include logic
   for handling these kinds of failure. While administrators should
   always investigate network interruptions and other system errors
   that cause failover, these events do not require direct intervention.

   For more information, see :doc:`/core/replica-set-high-availability`.

**Replica Set Deployment Architecture**

   Replica sets provide architectural flexibility to support the
   requirements of your application. For example, you may distribute
   replica sets across multiple data centers and geographical locations
   to provide redundancy and to increase data locality for distributed
   applications. The interfaces for replica sets provide semantics for
   targeting read and write operations to the replica set with an
   awareness of location and set configuration.

   For more information, see :doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures`
   and :doc:`/applications/replication`.
