A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :program:`mongod` processes
that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and
high availability, and are the standard basis for all production
deployments. The documents in this section introduce the operation of
replication in MongoDB, the components and architecture of replica
sets, and provide tutorials for common procedures and administrative
operations relevant to the use and maintenance of replica
sets. Specifically: 

:doc:`/core/replication-introduction`
   A through high-level introduction to replica sets. 

:doc:`/core/replication`
   Contains the core documentation of replica set features,
   configuration, architecture and behavior.

   :doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures`
      Introduces architectural considerations related to fault
      tolerance for deployment planning with replica sets.

      .. the above blurb is from /core/replication and should be
         synced to that.

   :doc:`/core/replica-set-members`
      Introduces the components of replica sets and presents the basic
      requirements and operation of replica set deployments.

      .. the above blurb is from /core/replication and should be
         synced to that.

   :doc:`/core/replica-set-high-availability`
      Replica sets provide automatic failover and recovery to support
      autonomous operation. If the primary of a set becomes
      unavailable, the set will elect one secondary to become primary.

   :doc:`/core/replication-process`
      While all members of a replica set can read operations, only the
      primary can accept write operations. As a result, MongoDB
      provides strict consistency among members. This *asynchronous*
      replication allows normal operation to continue even when some
      members of the set are unavailable. However, because of
      asynchronous replication, secondaries are not guaranteed to
      always have the latest operations.

   :doc:`/applications/replication`
      Replica sets provide semantics for targeting read and write
      operations to the replica set, with an awareness of location and
      set configuration.

:doc:`/administration/replica-sets`
   Tutorials that describe common procedures and administrative
   operations relevant to the use and maintenance of replica sets.

:doc:`/reference/replication`
   Reference for replication related functions and operations.
