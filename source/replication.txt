Replication
===========

Database replication ensures redundancy, backup, and automatic failover.
Replication occurs through groups of servers known as replica sets.

For an overview, see :doc:`/core/replication`. To work with members,
see :doc:`/tutorial/administer-replica-sets`. To configure deployment
architecture, see :doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-replica-sets`. To modify read and write
operations, see :doc:`/applications/replication`. For procedures for
performing certain replication tasks, see the :ref:`list of replication
tutorials <replica-set-tutorials-list>`. For documentation of MongoDB's
operational segregation capabilities for replica set deployments see
the :doc:`/data-center-awareness`

This section contains full documentation, tutorials, and pragmatic
guides, as well as links to the reference material that describes all
aspects of replica sets.

Replica Set Use and Operation
-----------------------------

Consider these higher level introductions to replica sets:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   core/replication
   core/replica-set-architectures
   applications/replication
   core/replication-internals

The following document describes master-slave replication, which is
deprecated. Use replica sets instead of master-slave in all new
deployments.

   :maxdepth: 1

   core/master-slave

Replica Set Reference Material
------------------------------

Additionally, consider the following reference listed in this section.
The following describes the replica set configuration object:

- :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`

The following describe MongoDB output and status related to
replication:

- :doc:`/reference/replica-status`
- :doc:`/reference/replication-info`

Finally, consider the following quick references of the commands and
operations available for replica set administration and use:
