Replication
===========

MongoDB supports database replication using a cluster of servers
known as a replica set. A replica set provides master-slave-style
replication with automated failover.

Fundamentals
------------

If you're just getting started with replication in MongoDB,
check out the core replication docs and the docs on using
replica sets on the application side:

* :doc:`Replication Fundamentals <core/replication>`
* :doc:`Application Development with Replica Sets <applications/replication>`

There's also a very good
`video introduction <http://www.10gen.com/presentations/mongosv-2011/a-mongodb-replication-primer-replica-sets-in-practice>`_.

Before deploying a replica set to production, you should use
one of the
:doc:`suggested replication architectures <administration/replication-architectures>`.
Basics administrative tasks such as adding and removing nodes are described in
:doc:`replica set administration <administration/replica-sets>`.

Finally, administrators and other advanced users will want to read up on
:doc:`replication internals <core/replication-internals>`.

Tutorials
---------

The following tutorials describe certain replica set maintenance
operations in detail.

Reference
---------

Finally, we provide some reference material on replication. The first
is a reference to the replica set configuration object:

- :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`

The next two describe the output of the replication status commands:

- :doc:`/reference/replica-status`
- :doc:`/reference/replication-info`

.. DOCS-120 need to add data center awareness to an existing document.
