A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :program:`mongod` processes
that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and
high availability, and are the standard basis for all production
deployments. The documents in this section introduce the operation of
replication in MongoDB, the components and architecture of replica
sets, and provide tutorials for common procedures and administrative
operations relevant to the use and maintenance of replica
sets. Specifically: 

.. class:: toc

   :doc:`/core/replication-introduction`
      A top-down introduction to replica sets, and their behavior,
      operation, and use. 

   :doc:`/core/replication`
      The core documentation of replica set operations, capabilities,
      configurations, architectures and behaviors.

      :doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures`
         Introduces architectural considerations related to fault
         tolerance for deployment planning with replica sets.

         .. the above blurb is from /core/replication and should be
            synced to that.

      :doc:`/core/replica-set-members`
         Introduces the components of replica sets and presents the basic
         requirements and operation of replica set deployments.

         .. the above blurb is from /core/replication and should be
            synced to that.

      :doc:`/core/replica-set-high-availability`
         Details of the automatic failover and recovery process with
         replica sets.

      :doc:`/core/replication-process`
         Mechanics of the replication process and related topics.

      :doc:`/applications/replication`
         Presents the semantics for targeting read and write
         operations to the replica set, with an awareness of location and
         set configuration.

   :doc:`/administration/replica-sets`
      Tutorials for common procedures and administrative
      operations relevant to the use and maintenance of replica sets.

   :doc:`/reference/replication`
