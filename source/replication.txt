Replication
===========

MongoDB supports database replication using a cluster of servers
known as a replica set. A replica set provides master-slave-style
replication with automated failover.

If you're just getting started with replication in MongoDB, check out
the :doc:`core replication docs </core/replication>` and the docs on
:doc:`using replica sets in the application development
<applications/replication>`.

There's also a very good `video introduction`_ to replica sets in
MongoDB.

Before deploying a replica set to production, you should be familiar
with the :doc:`suggested replication architectures
<administration/replication-architectures>`. The :doc:`replica set
administration <administration/replica-sets>` document covers basic
administrative tasks such as adding and removing nodes.

Finally, administrators and other advanced users will want to read up
on :doc:`replication internals <core/replication-internals>` and
consider the :ref:`replication reference material <replication-reference>`

Reference
---------

Finally, consider the replication reference material. The first is a
reference to the replica set configuration object and process:

- :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`

The next two documents describe the output of the replication status
commands:

- :doc:`/reference/replica-status`
- :doc:`/reference/replication-info`

.. _replica-set-data-center-awareness:

.. DOCS-120 need to add data center awareness to an existing document.
