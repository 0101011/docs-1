MongoDB CRUD Operations
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides the ability to read as well as manipulate your data.  The
operations that provide this functionality are commonly referred to as CRUD
which stands for *create*, *read*, *update*, and *delete*. These four abstract
operations provide the fundamental basis of all client interaction with a
database. *Create*, *update*, and *delete* are the core data manipulation
operations, while queries are *read* operations.
