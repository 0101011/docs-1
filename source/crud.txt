CRUD stands for *create*, *read*, *update*, and
*delete*, which are the four core database operations used in
database driven application development. The :ref:`crud-operations`
section provides introduction to each class of operation along with
complete examples of each operation. The documents in the
:ref:`crud-read-and-write` section provide a higher level overview of
the behavior and available functionality of these operations.
