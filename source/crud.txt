CRUD stands for :term:`create`, :term:`read`, :term:`update`, and
:term:`delete`, which are the four core database operations, used in
database driven application development. The :ref:`crud-operations`
section provides introduction to each class of operation along with
complete examples of each operation. The documents in the
:ref:`crud-read-and-write` section provide a higher level overview of
the behavior and available functionality of these operations.
