Indexes provide high performance read operations for frequently used
queries. Indexes are particularly useful where the total size of the
documents exceeds the amount of available RAM.

This section introduces indexes in MongoDB, describes the types and
configuration options for indexes, and describes special types of
indexing MongoDB supports. The section also provides tutorials
detailing procedures and operational concerns, and providing
information on how applications may use indexes.
