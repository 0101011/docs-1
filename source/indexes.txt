MongoDB's indexes make it possible to provide high performance read
operations for frequently used queries. Indexes are particularly
useful where the total size of the documents exceeds the amount of
available RAM. This section has three main documents:
:doc:`/core/indexes` that explains basic indexing concepts and
options, :doc:`/administration/indexes` that outlines procedures and
operational concerns relevant to indexing, and
:doc:`/applications/indexes` that introduces how your application may
use indexes.
