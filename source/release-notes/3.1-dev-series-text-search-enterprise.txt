=======================================================
Development Series 3.1.x Text Search Enterprise Edition
=======================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 3.2 is currently in development as part of the 3.1.x
development release series. 

.. warning::

   While 3.1.x releases are available, these versions of MONGODB are
   for **testing purposes only and not for production use**.

This document covers the 3.1 development series as a work-in-progress.
Features are subject to change. See also
:doc:`/release-notes/3.1-dev-series`.

Text Search Enhancements
------------------------

.. |version-dev| replace:: 3.1.6

Starting in |version-dev|, MongoDB Enterprise provides support for the
following languages: Arabic, Farsi (specifically Dari and Iranian
Persian dialects), Urdu, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

New Language Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the new languages, the text search feature uses the
three-letter language codes defined in ISO 636-3.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 25 25

   * - Language Name
     - ISO 636-3 (Three letter codes)
     - RLP names (Three letter codes)

   * - ``arabic``
     - ``ara``
     -

   * - ``dari``
     - ``prs``
     -

   * - ``iranian persian``
     - ``pes`` 
     -

   * - ``urdu``
     - ``urd``
     -

   * - ``simplified chinese`` or ``hans``
     - 
     - ``zhs``

   * - ``traditional chinese`` or ``hant``
     - 
     - ``zht``

Rosette Linguistics Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To provide support for these languages, MongoDB Enterprise integrates Basis
Technology Rosette Linguistics Platform (RLP) to perform normalization, word
breaking, sentence breaking, and stemming or tokenization depending on the
language.

MongoDB Enterprise supports RLP SDK 7.11.1 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6.x. For information on providing support on other platforms, contact
your sales representative.

RLP License
```````````

To use MongoDB with RLP, MongoDB requires a license for the Base
Linguistics component of RLP and one or more languages specified above.
MongoDB does not require a license for all 6 languages listed above.

Support for any of the specified languages is conditional on having a
valid RLP license for the language. For instance, if there is only an
RLP license provided for Arabic, then MongoDB will only enable support
for Arabic and will not enable support for any other RLP based
languages. For any language which lacks a valid license, the MongoDB
log will contain a warning message. Additionally, you can set the
MongoDB log verbosity level to ``2`` to log debug messages that
identify each supported language.

You do not need the Language Extension Pack as MongoDB does not support
these RLP languages at this time.

Contact Basis Technology at info@basistech.com to get a copy of RLP and
a license for one or more languages. For more information on how
to contact Basis Technology, see http://www.basistech.com/contact/.

Additional Information
``````````````````````

For installation help, see the RLP Quick Start manual or Chapter 2 of
the Rosette Linguistics Platform Application Developerâ€™s Guide.

For debugging any RLP specific issues, you can set the ``rlpVerbose``
parameter to ``true`` (i.e. ``--setParameter rlpVerbose=true``) to view
``INFO`` messages from RLP.

.. warning::

   Enabling ``rlpVerbose`` has a performance overhead and should only
   be enabled for troubleshooting installation issues.
