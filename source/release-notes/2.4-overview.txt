What’s New in MongoDB 2.4
=========================

MongoDB 2.4.0 represents hundreds of improvements and features driven by community requests. MongoDB 2.4 builds on the momentum of 2.2 by introducing new features that enable greater developer productivity, easier operations, improved performance and enhanced security. MongoDB 2.4 is available for `download on MongoDB.org <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_

Developer Productivity
----------------------

* Aggregation Framework refinements include an overhaul of the underlying engine introduced in MongoDB 2.2 making it easier to leverage real-time, in-place analytics. MongoDB 2.4 includes significant performance improvements, additional support for binary data, support for $within and $near geo queries, improved string concatenation with the new $concat operator, and improved date calculation semantics. 
* Geospatial enhancements enable new use cases with polygon intersects polygon queries as well as support for GeoJSON and an improved spherical model.

* Text Search provides a simplified, integrated approach to incorporating search functionality into apps with support for language specific stemming and stop words in 15 languages and real time indexes. (Note: this feature is currently in beta status and isn’t recommended for production use) `learn more about text search <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/2.4/#text-indexes>`_
* Development is greatly simplified using the new $push capabilities which make it easy to incorporate fixed, sorted lists for features like leaderboards and logging . `learn more about capped arrays <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/2.4/#each-slice-and-sort-available-for-use-with-push>`_
* Upsert has new capabilities with the ability to set creation defaults with $setOnInsert.

Ease of Operations
------------------

* Hashed-Based Sharding provides simple, even distribution for reads and writes. `Learn more about Hashed Shard Keys <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/2.4/#new-hashed-index-and-sharding-with-a-hashed-shard-key>`_
* Working Set Analyzer makes capacity planning easier for ops teams. `Learn more about the working set analyzer <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/server-status/#server-status-workingset>`_
* Replication improvements simplifies management and provides better resiliency particularly when running on networks with lower consistency like the cloud. MongoDB 2.4 also features a much faster initial sync when adding new secondaries to a replica set. 
* More control for operators with the ability to kill indexing operations with automatic resource cleanup. 

Improved Performance
--------------------

* V8 JavaScript engine offers better performance and concurrency with JavaScript based actions including map-reduce, $where and eval commands. `Learn more about MongoDB on V8 <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/2.4/#javascript-engine-changed-to-v8>`_
* Improvements to counting provide dramatically faster count operations. Counting is now up to 20x faster for low cardinality index based counts.
* Significant optimizations to $elemMatch when using a multikey index.

More Robust Security
--------------------

* Role-Based privileges allow organizations to assign more granular security policies for server, database and cluster administration. `Learn more about role based access control in MongoDB <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/user-privileges/>`_
* Kerberos authentication mechanism using SASL in MongoDB Enterprise.

MongoDB Enterprise
------------------

MongoDB Enterprise is a commercial edition of MongoDB that includes enterprise-grade capabilities, such as advanced security features, management tools, software integrations and certifications. Available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Subscription, this edition includes 10gen’s most comprehensive SLA and a commercial license. `More information on MongoDB Enterprise can be found here <http://ENTERPRISELINKHERE>`_
