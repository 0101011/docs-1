MongoDB 
-------

The following changes in MongoDB affect both standard and Enterprise
editions:

Major Features and Enhancements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _2.4-release-text-indexes:

Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~

   Add support for text search of content in MongoDB databases as a
   *beta* feature. See :doc:`/core/text-search` for more information.

.. _2.4-release-geospatial:

Geospatial Support Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add new :doc:`2dsphere index </core/2dsphere>`. The new index
  supports `GeoJSON <http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`_ objects
  ``Point``, ``LineString``, and ``Polygon``. For more information, see
  :doc:`/core/2dsphere` and :doc:`/applications/geospatial-indexes`.

- Introduce operators :operator:`$geometry`, :operator:`$geoWithin` and
  :operator:`$geoIntersects` to work with the GeoJSON data.

.. _2.4-release-hashed-indexes:

Hashed Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Add new :ref:`hashed index <index-type-hashed>` to index documents
   using hashes of field values. When used to index a shard key, the
   hashed index ensures an evenly distributed shard key. See also
   :ref:`sharding-hashed-sharding`.

.. DOCS-752

Improvements to the Aggregation Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improve support for geospatial queries. See the
  :operator:`$geoWithin` operator and the :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline
  stage.

- Improve sort efficiency when the :pipeline:`$sort` stage immediately
  precedes a :pipeline:`$limit` in the pipeline. 

- Add new operators :expression:`$millisecond` and
  :expression:`$concat` and modify how :group:`$min` operator processes
  ``null`` values.

.. _2.4-fixed-size-arrays:

Changes to Update Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add new :operator:`$setOnInsert` operator for use with
  :method:`upsert <db.collection.update()>` .

- Enhance functionality of the :operator:`$push` operator, supporting
  its use with the :operator:`$each`, the :operator:`$sort`, and the
  :operator:`$slice` modifiers.

Additional Limitations for Map-Reduce and ``$where`` Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command, :dbcommand:`group` command, and
   the :operator:`$where` operator expressions cannot access certain
   global functions or properties, such as ``db``, that are available
   in the :program:`mongo` shell. See the individual command or
   operator for details.

.. _2.4-release-server-status:

Improvements to ``serverStatus`` Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Provide additional metrics and customization for the
   :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command. See :method:`db.serverStatus()`
   and :dbcommand:`serverStatus` for more information.

.. _2.4-privilege-documents:
.. _2.4-unique-users:

Security Enhancements
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Introduce a role-based access control system
  :doc:`/reference/user-privileges` using new
  :doc:`/reference/privilege-documents`.

- Enforce uniqueness of the user in user privilege documents per
  database. Previous versions of MongoDB did not enforce this
  requirement, and existing databases may have duplicates.

For more information, see :doc:`MongoDB Security Practices and
Procedures </security>`.

Improved Performance and Operation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _2.4-release-javascript-change:

V8 JavaScript Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. toctree::
      :hidden:

      /release-notes/2.4-javascript

  Change default JavaScript engine from SpiderMonkey to V8. The change
  provides improved concurrency for JavaScript operations, modernized
  JavaScript implementation, and the removal of non-standard
  SpiderMonkey features, and affects all JavaScript behavior including
  the commands :dbcommand:`mapReduce`, :dbcommand:`group`, and
  :dbcommand:`eval` and the query operator :operator:`$where`.

  See :doc:`/release-notes/2.4-javascript` for more information about
  all changes .

BSON Document Validation Enabled by Default for ``mongod`` and ``mongorestore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Enable basic :term:`BSON` object validation for :program:`mongod`
   and :program:`mongorestore` when writing to MongoDB data files. See
   :setting:`objcheck` for details.

Index Build Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for multiple concurrent index builds in the background by
  a single :program:`mongod` instance. See :ref:`building indexes in
  the background <index-creation-background>` for more information on
  background index builds.
  
- Allow the :method:`db.killOp()` method to terminate a foreground
  index build.

- Improve index validation during index creation. See
  :doc:`/release-notes/2.4-index-types` for more information.

Set Parameters as Command Line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Provide ``--setParameter`` as a command line option for
   :program:`mongos` and :program:`mongod`. See :program:`mongod` and
   :program:`mongos` for list of available options for
   :setting:`setParameter`.

Increased Chunk Migration Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The default write concern for insert and delete operations that
   occur as part of a :term:`chunk` migration in a :term:`sharded
   cluster` now ensures that at least one secondary acknowledges each
   insert and deletion operation. See
   :ref:`chunk-migration-write-concern`.

Improved Chunk Migration Queue Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Increase performance for moving multiple chunks off an overloaded
   shard. The balancer no longer waits for the current migration's
   delete phase to complete before starting the next chunk migration.
   See :ref:`chunk-migration-queing` for details.

.. _mongodb-enterprise:

MongoDB Enterprise
------------------

The following changes are specific to MongoDB Enterprise Editions:

Enhanced SSL Support
++++++++++++++++++++

   MongoDB supports support encrypted connections using SSL
   certificates signed by a Certificate Authority. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.

.. _2.4.4-sasl-change:

SASL Library Change
+++++++++++++++++++

   In 2.4.4, MongoDB Enterprise uses Cyrus SASL. Earlier 2.4 Enterprise
   versions use GNU SASL (``libgsasl``). To upgrade to 2.4.4 MongoDB
   Enterprise or greater, you **must** install all package dependencies
   related to this change, including the appropriate Cyrus SASL ``GSSAPI``
   library. See :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise` for details of
   the dependencies.

.. _kerberos-authentication:

New Modular Authentication System with Support for Kerberos
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   In 2.4, the MongoDB Enterprise now supports authentication via a
   Kerberos mechanism. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`
   for more information.

   Also consider the following documents that address authenticating to
   MongoDB using Kerberos:

   - :ecosystem:`Authenticate to MongoDB using Kerberos and the Java
     Driver </tutorial/authenticate-with-java-driver/>`

   - :ecosystem:`Authenticate to MongoDB using Kerberos and the C# Driver
     </tutorial/authenticate-with-csharp-driver/>`

   For more information, see :doc:`MongoDB Security Practices and
   Procedures </security>`.

Platform Support
----------------

For OS X, MongoDB 2.4 only supports OS X versions 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
and later. There are no other platform support changes in MongoDB
2.4. See the `downloads page <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads/>`_ for
more information on platform support.
