Journaling
==========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

:term:`Journaling <journal>` ensures durability of data by storing
:doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>` in an on-disk
journal prior to applying them to the data files. The journal
ensures write operations can be re-applied in the event of a crash.

Journaling ensures that :program:`mongodb` is crash resilient. *Without*
a journal, if :program:`mongodb` exits unexpectedly, you must assume
your data is in an inconsistent state and must either run
:doc:`repair </tutorial/recover-data-following-unexpected-shutdown>`
or :ref:`resync <replica-set-resync-stale-member>` from a clean member
of the replica set.

With journaling, if :program:`mongodb` stops unexpectedly, the program
can recover everything written to the journal, and the data is in a
consistent state. By default, the greatest extent of lost writes, i.e.,
those not made to the journal, is no more than the last 100
milliseconds.


.. versionchanged:: 2.0
   Journaling is enabled by default for 64-bit platforms.
   For other platforms, see :setting:`journal`.

How Journaling Works
--------------------

When running with journaling, MongoDB stores and applies :doc:`write
operations </core/write-operations>` in memory and in the journal before
the changes are in the data files.

This section explains this process in detail.

.. _journaling-configuring-storage:

Storage Locations used in Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Journaling adds three storage locations to MongoDB.

The ``shared view`` stores modified data for upload to the MongoDB
data files. The ``shared view`` is the only location with direct access
to the MongoDB data files. When running with journaling, :program:`mongod`
asks the operating system to map your
existing on-disk data files to the ``shared view`` memory location. The
operating system maps the files but does not load them. MongoDB later
loads data files to ``shared view`` as needed.

The ``private view`` stores data for use in :doc:`read operations
</core/read-operations>`. The ``private view`` is mapped to the ``shared view``
and is the first place MongoDB applies new :doc:`write operations
</core/write-operations>`, mean read operations get the most up-to-date
data. Keep in mind that because the ``private view`` is a second mapping
of data files, journaling often doubles the amount of virtual memory
:program:`mongod` uses.

The journal is an on-disk location that stores new write operations
after they have been applied to the ``private cache`` but before they
have been applied to the data files. The journal provides durability.
If the :program:`mongod` instance were to crash without having applied
the writes to the data files, the journal could replay the writes to
the ``shared view`` for eventual upload to the data files.

.. _journaling-record-write-operation:

How Journaling Records Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As users perform :doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>`,
MongoDB writes the data to the ``private view`` in RAM, making it
immediately available for :doc:`read operations
</core/read-operations>`.

MongoDB then copies the write operations in batches from the ``private
view`` to the journal, which stores the operations on disk to ensure
durability. When writing to the journal, MongoDB adds a write operation as
an entry on the journal's forward pointer. Each entry on the pointer
describes which bytes the write operation changed in the data files.
(The journal also has a behind pointer, discussed later in this
section.)

MongoDB copies the write operations to the journal in batches
called group commits. By default, MongoDB performs a group commit every
100 milliseconds, which means a series of operations over 100
milliseconds are committed as a single batch. This is done to achieve
high performance.

MongoDB next applies the journal's write operations to the ``shared
view``. At this point, the ``shared view`` becomes inconsistent with the data files.

At default intervals of 60 seconds, MongoDB asks the operating system to
flush the ``shared view`` to disk. This brings the data files up-to-date
with the latest write operations.

When write operations are flushed to the data files, MongoDB removes the
write operations from the journal's behind pointer. The behind pointer
is always far back from advanced pointer.

As part of journaling, MongoDB routinely asks the operating system to
remap the ``shared view`` to the ``private view``, for consistency.

.. note:: The interaction between the ``shared view`` and the on-disk
   data files is not dissimilar to how MongoDB works *without*
   journaling, which is that MongoDB asks the operating system to flush
   in-memory changes back to the data files every 60 seconds.

What Journaling Stores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Journaling stores:

- documents
- indexes
- meta data on collections and databases
- journals, which are information about the information stored

.. _journaling-journal-files:

Journal Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With journaling enabled, MongoDB creates a journal directory within
your database directory. The journal directory holds journal files,
which contain write-ahead redo logs. The directory also holds a
last-sequence-number file. A clean shutdown removes all the files in the
journal directory.

Journal files are append-only files and are named with the ``j._``
prefix. When a journal file reaches 1 gigabyte, a new file is created.
Files that no longer are needed are automatically deleted. Unless your
write-bytes-per-second rate is extremely high, the directory should
contain only two or three journal files.

To limit the size of journal files to 128 megabytes per file, use the
:option:`--smallfiles` command line option when starting
:program:`mongod`.

To speed the frequent sequential writes that occur to the current
journal file, you can symbolically link the journal directory to a
dedicated hard drive before starting :program:`mongod`.

In some cases, you might experience a preallocation lag the first time
you start a :program:`mongod` instance with journaling enabled. MongoDB
may determine that it is faster to preallocate journal files than to
create them as needed. This would be the case if it is faster on your
file system to write to files of predefined sizes than to append files.
If MongoDB preallocates the files, you might experience a several
minutes delay on first startup of :program:`mongod`. You will not be
able to connect to the database until the preallocation completes. This
is a one-time preallocation and does not occur with future invocations.
Check the logs to see if MongoDB is preallocating. The logs will display
the standard "waiting for connections on port" message when complete.

To avoid this lag, see :ref:`journaling-avoid-preallocation-lag`.

Configuration and Setup
-----------------------

Enable Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning with version 2.0, journaling is enabled by default for 64-bit
platforms.

To enable journaling, start :program:`mongod` with the
:option:`--journal` command line option.

If :program:`mongod` decides to preallocate the files, it will not start
listening on port 27017 until this process completes, which can take a
few minutes. This means that your applications and the shell will not be
able to connect to the database immediately on initial startup. Check
the logs to see if MongoDB is busy preallocating.

Disable Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable journaling, start :program:`mongod` with the
:option:`--nojournal <mongod --nojournal>` command line option.

It is OK to disable journaling after running with journaling. Simply
shut down :program:`mongod` cleanly and restart with
:option:`--nojournal <mongod --nojournal>`.

Get Commit Acknowledgement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can wait for group commit acknowledgement with the getLastError
Command. In versions before 1.9.0 using getLastError + fsync would do
this, in newer versions the "j" option has been specifically created for
this purpose.

In version 1.9.2+ the group commit delay is shortened when a commit
acknowledgement (getLastError + j) is pending; this can be as little as
1/3 of the normal group commit interval.

.. _journaling-avoid-preallocation-lag:

Avoid Preallocation Lag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid preallocation lag, you can preallocate files in the journal
directory by copying them from another instance of :program:`mongod`.
(For details on preallocation lag, see :ref:`journaling-journal-files`.)

.. example:: The following sequence of commands preallocates journal
   files for an instance of :program:`mongod` running on port ``27017``
   with a database path of ``/data/db``.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ mkdir ~/tmpDbpath
      $ mongod --port 10000 --dbpath ~/tmpDbpath --journal
      # startup messages
      # .
      # .
      # .
      # wait for prealloc to finish
      Thu Mar 17 10:02:52 [initandlisten] preallocating a journal file
      ~/tmpDbpath/journal/prealloc.0
      Thu Mar 17 10:03:03 [initandlisten] preallocating a journal file
      ~/tmpDbpath/journal/prealloc.1
      Thu Mar 17 10:03:14 [initandlisten] preallocating a journal file
      ~/tmpDbpath/journal/prealloc.2
      Thu Mar 17 10:03:25 [initandlisten] flushing directory
      ~/tmpDbpath/journal
      Thu Mar 17 10:03:25 [initandlisten] flushing directory
      ~/tmpDbpath/journal
      Thu Mar 17 10:03:25 [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port
      10000
      Thu Mar 17 10:03:25 [websvr] web admin interface listening on port 11000
      # then Ctrl-C to kill this instance
      ^C
      $ mv ~/tmpDbpath/journal /data/db/
      $ # restart mongod on port 27017 with --journal

Preallocated files do not contain data. It is safe to remove them. But
if you restart :program:`mongod` with journaling, :program:`mongod` will
create them again.

Change the Group Commit Interval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning with version 1.9.2, you can set the group commit interval
using the :option:`--journalCommitInterval <mongod
--journalCommitInterval>` command line option. The allowed range is ``2`` to
``300`` milliseconds.

Monitor journal Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

serverStatus command

The serverStatus command now includes some statistics regarding
journaling.

journalLatencyTest Command

You can use the journalLatencyTest command to measure how long it takes
on your volume to write to the disk (including fsyncing the data) in an
append-only fashion.

> use admin

> db.runCommand("journalLatencyTest")

You can run this command on an idle system to get a baseline sync time
for journaling. In addition, it is safe to run this command on a busy
system to see the sync time on a busy system (which may be higher if the
journal directory is on the same volume as the data files).

In version 1.9.2+ you can set the group commit interval, using
--journalCommitInterval command-line option, to between 2 and 300
milliseconds (default is 100ms). The actual interval are the maximum
of this setting and your disk latency as measured above.

journalLatencyTest is also a good way to check if your disk drive is
buffering writes in its local cache. If the number is very low (e.g.,
less than 2ms) and the drive is non-ssd, the drive is probably buffering
writes. In that case, you will want to enable cache write-through for
the device in your operating system. (Unless you have a disk controller
card with battery backed ram, then this is a good thing.)

Command-line Options
--------------------

- `--master`: The :term:`master` mode.

- :option:`--oplogSize`: This takes an argument and specifies the size
  limit in MB for the oplog.

- `--slave`: The :term:`slave` mode.

- `--source`: This takes an argument and specifies the master as
  <server:port>.

- `--only`: This takes an argument and specifies a single database to
  replicate.

Recovery
--------

On a restart after a crash, journal files in journal are replayed
before the server goes online. This is indicated in the log output.
You do not need to run a repair.

With journaling if you want a dataset to reside entirely in RAM, you
need twice as much RAM available as the dataset size to be able to store
the ``shared view`` and ``private view``.

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recommend to set (or at least check) for a low read ahead value
for the data disks, say 40 blocks.

– And 0 for non-spinning disks

Recommend to use a separate disk for the journal entries, with a
slightly higher read ahead, say 100 blocks

– Writes are always at the end of the journal

– Deletes are always at the beginning of the journal

Include checking the read ahead values in onboarding interviews

Set the read ahead values in the templates we distribute

Be aware of the issue for sudden performance breakdown tickets

– Beware of resident memory estimates when diagnosing RAM usage
