Indexing Operations

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly by creating
small and efficient representations of the documents in a collection.

The documents in this section outline specific tasks related to
building and maintaining indexes for data in MongoDB collections. For
a conceptual overview of MongoDB indexing, see the
:doc:`/core/indexes` document. For strategies and practical
approaches, see the :doc:`/applications/indexes` document.
