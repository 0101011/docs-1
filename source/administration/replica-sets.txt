Replica Set Tutorials
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Administrative tasks for replica sets include initial deployment of the
set, adding and reconfiguring members, and targeting operations to
specific members to balance load and improve efficiency. Administrators
generally need not intervene in failover or replication processes, as
replica sets automate these. For the rare situations where an
administrator must resync a member or reconfigure a set, the tutorials
describe how to do so. These tutorials form the basis for all replica
set administration.
