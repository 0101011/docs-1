Replica Set Tutorials
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The following tutorial describe procedures for deploying, configuring
and maintaining :term:`replica sets <replica set>`. Practically,

administrator intervention. Nevertheless, Replica sets provide the
basis of all MongoDB deployments, and these procedures form the basis
for all MongoDB administration.
