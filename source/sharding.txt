   Introduction
   ------------

Sharding is the process of storing data records across multiple
machines and is MongoDB's approach to meeting the demands of data
growth. As the size of the data increases, a single machine may not be
sufficient to store the data nor provide an acceptable read and write
throughput. Sharding solves the problem with horizontal scaling. With
sharding, you add more machines to support data growth and the demands
of read and write operations.

**Sharding in MongoDB**

   MongoDB uses a range-based approach to sharding a collection of
   data records. A common field(s) from these data records defines a
   range of values. MongoDB partitions this range into non-overlapping
   ranges, and the field(s) that defines this space is the
   :term:`shard key`.  The segmented ranges define the logical
   :term:`chunks <chunk>`. Each chunk represents a smaller range of
   values within the shard key range and each chunk refers to all the
   document whose shard key value falls within that range.

   MongoDB distributes the documents in each chunk across multiple
   machines or :term:`shards <shard>`. A set of :program:`mongod`
   instances called the :term:`config server <config database>` tracks
   the relationship between shards, chunks, and shard key ranges.

   To shield client applications from the internals of sharding, a
   router called :term:`mongos` directs the queries from applications
   to the shards.  Together, the :term:`shards <shard>`, the
   :term:`config server(s) <config database>`, and the :term:`mongos`
   form a :term:`sharded cluster`.

**Application Transparency**

   From the perspective of the application, there is no difference
   between a sharded cluster and a standalone :program:`mongod`
   instance.

   Applications issue queries to the router :program:`mongos`. If the
   router can determine from the query which shard(s) contains the
   pertinent data records, :program:`mongos` will target only those
   shard(s). Otherwise, :program:`mongos` will route the queries to
   all the shards that contain data records for the collection.

**Automatic Data Distribution and Balancing**

   MongoDB ensures a balanced distribution of the data through two
   automatic processes: migrating and splitting. Migrating physically
   moves chunks between shards to ensure a balanced distribution of chunks
   across shards. Splitting modifies a chunk's range definition to create
   two chunks from one to ensure similar data volume sizes for the chunks.
   Splitting does not involve physical movement of data on disk.

**Data Distribution and Balancing Controls**

   Although the data distribution and balancing is automatic, MongoDB
   provides users with certain controls over the behavior of these
   processes.

   For instance, MongoDB allows for *hashed shard key* which consists of a
   single field whose hashed values define a key space. The hashed
   values introduces a measure of randomness to the value to ensure that
   the data records are more evenly distributed across shards. With an
   even distribution of data records, you can reduce the frequency and
   need to balance data across shards.

   You can also tag a shard and then associate specific ranges of the
   shard key with that tag. With this association, you can control the
   balancing process so that in a geographically distributed cluster, the
   most relevant portions of the data set reside on the shards with the
   greatest proximity to the application servers.
