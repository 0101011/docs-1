.. default-domain:: mongodb

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Although
there may be more than one way to model a single type of application
data in MongoDB, different data model can have significant impacts on
MongoDB and application performance.

Read the :doc:`/core/data-modeling-introduction` document for a high
level introduction to data modeling, and proceed to the documents in
the :doc:`/core/data-models` section for additional documentation of
the data model design process. Finally the
:ref:`data-modeling-patterns` documents provide examples of different
data models. In addition, the :ecosystem:`MongoDB Use Case Studies
</use-cases>` provide overviews of application design and include
example data models with MongoDB.
