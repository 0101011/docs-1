.. default-domain:: mongodb

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Although you
may be able to use different structures for a single data set in
MongoDB, different data models may have significant impacts on MongoDB
and application performance.

Consider :doc:`/core/data-models` for a conceptual overview of data
modeling problems in MongoDB, and the :ref:`data-modeling-patterns`
documents for examples of different approaches to data
models. Additionally, the :ecosystem:`MongoDB Use Case Studies
</use-cases>` provide overviews of application design, and include
example data models, with MongoDB.
