Supported Platforms
-------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-platforms.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-32-bit.rst

.. versionchanged:: 3.0

   Commercial support is no longer provided for MongoDB on 32-bit
   platforms (Linux and Windows). See
   :ref:`3.0-compatibility-platform-support`.

The 32-bit versions of MongoDB have the following limitations:

- 32-bit versions of MongoDB do **not** support the WiredTiger storage
  engine.

- 32-bit builds disable :term:`journaling <journal>` by default because
  journaling further limits the maximum amount of data that the
  database can store.

- When running a 32-bit build of MongoDB, the total storage size for
  the server, including data and indexes, is 2 gigabytes. For this
  reason, do not deploy MongoDB to production on 32-bit machines.

If you are running a 64-bit build of MongoDB, there is virtually no
limit to storage size. For production deployments, 64-bit builds and
operating systems are strongly recommended.
