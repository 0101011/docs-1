==================
The MongoDB Manual
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Welcome to the MongoDB Manual! The Manual begins by introducing
MongoDB and continues to describe the query language, operational
considerations and procedures, administration, among other topics in
addition to a thorough reference.

This manual is under constant development, and will soon replace the
existing :ref:`MongoDB Wiki <mongodb-wiki>`. See the ":doc:`/about`"
page for an overview of the MongoDB Documentation project.  For now,
documentation resources coexist and link to one another. As you
explore the manual, expect to move between documentation sites.

Getting Started
---------------

MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented database designed for
ease of development and scalability, with particular emphasis on
Internet applications and infrastructure.  If you're new to
MongoDB, begin with the following resources:

- :doc:`Installing MongoDB <installation>`
- :wiki:`The MongoDB Tutorial <Tutorial>`
- :doc:`Frequently Asked Questions </faq/fundamentals>`
- :doc:`/release-notes`

MongoDB has an :wiki:`active community <community>`. You'll get a
quick response to any question posted to the `MongoDB User Mailing List`_

   - **For Developers**

     The first task when building an application with MongoDB, is
     selecting a programming :doc:`language and driver
     <applications/drivers>`. Most of the drivers have their own
     tutorials; however, for all drivers you may want to understand a
     few core MongoDB concepts, particularly:

     - :doc:`/core/document`
     - :doc:`/applications/read-operations`
     - :doc:`/applications/write-operations`

     If you're familiar with database systems that use SQL, consider
     the following documents, which compare common MongoDB conventions and
     operations with their SQL equivalents:

     - :doc:`/reference/sql-comparison`
     - :doc:`/reference/sql-aggregation-comparison`

     Of the developer docs, those covering CRUD (create, read, update,
     and delete) provide useful examples and introductions:

     - :doc:`/applications/create`,
     - :doc:`/applications/read`,
     - :doc:`/applications/update`, and
     - :doc:`/applications/delete`.

     As you become more familiar with CRUD in MongoDB also consider:

     - :doc:`Indexing </indexes>` and
     - :doc:`data aggregation </aggregation>` in MongoDB.

     To continue learning about :doc:`application development
     </applications>` with MongoDB skim the :doc:`developer FAQs
     <faq/developers>` and consider the :doc:`use case documentation
     </use-cases>`. Also the :doc:`tutorials </tutorials>`
     documentation.

   - **For Administrators**

     If you're administering MongoDB, you'll need to know at least the
     basics of :wiki:`querying <Querying>` MongoDB and :wiki:`using
     the shell <Overview+-+The+MongoDB+Interactive+Shell>`. You can
     then the Manual's :doc:`administration </administration>`
     section.

     First have a look at :doc:`configuration
     </administration/configuration>`. Then familiarize yourself with
     MongoDB's clustered deployment options:

     - :doc:`Replication </replication>`
     - :doc:`Sharding </sharding>`

     Most deployments consist of a single replica set. Scaling the
     database on existing hardware usually involves sharding. If you
     are deploying MongoDB to production, be sure to familiarize
     yourself with the following topics:

     - :doc:`Security </security>`
     - :doc:`Backups </administration/backups>`
     - :doc:`Monitoring </administration/monitoring>`
     - :wiki:`Hardware and System Settings <Production+Notes>`

     Also consider the :ref:`Administration Tutorials
     <tutorials-administration>`.

Reference
---------

This manual features a detailed reference, including: a JavaScript
method reference, detailed documentation of all operators in the
MongoDB query language, manual pages for all MongoDB tools and
binaries, a reference of all database commands, and full glossary and
topic index.

- :doc:`/reference/javascript`
- :doc:`/reference/operators`
- :ref:`MongoDB Manual Pages <man-pages>`
- :doc:`/reference/commands`
- :doc:`/reference/glossary`
- :ref:`MongoDB Manual Topic Index <genindex>`

Also consider the full :doc:`outline of the MongoDB Manual
<contents>`, and an index of all :doc:`MongoDB tutorials <tutorial>`.

MongoDB Wiki
------------

This manual will eventually replace the :wiki:`MongoDB Wiki <>`. Until
then, you'll have to use both to get the best information on
MongoDB. The following pages from the wiki are especially useful:
