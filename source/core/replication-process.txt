Replication Processes

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The replication of data among replica set members occur through the
synchronization of a special :term:`capped collection` called the
:doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>` that logs the operations that
modify the data. This section provides details of the oplog and the
internal mechanics of the replication process.
