============================
Sharded and Non-Sharded Data
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Sharding operates on the collection level. You can shard multiple
collections within a database or have multiple databases with
sharding enabled. [#sharding-databases]_ However, in production
deployments, some databases and collections will use sharding, while
other databases and collections will only reside on a single
shard.

Regardless of the data architecture of your :term:`sharded cluster`,
ensure that all queries and operations use the :term:`mongos` router to
access the data cluster. Use the :program:`mongos` even for operations
that do not impact the sharded data.

.. [#sharding-databases] As you configure sharding, you will use the
   :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command to enable sharding for a
   database. This simply makes it possible to use the
   :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command on a collection within that database.
