Primary Shard
-------------

Every database has a "primary" [#overloaded-primary-term]_ shard that
holds all un-sharded collections in that database. All collections
that *are not* sharded reside on the primary for their database. Use
the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command to change the primary shard for a
database. Use the :method:`db.printShardingStatus()` command or the
:method:`sh.status()` to see an overview of the cluster, which contains
information about the :term:`chunk` and database distribution within the
cluster.

.. warning::

   The :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command can be expensive because
   it copies all non-sharded data to the new shard, during which
   that data will be unavailable for other operations.

When you deploy a new :term:`sharded cluster`, the "first shard" becomes
the primary for all databases before enabling sharding. Databases
created subsequently, may reside on any shard in the cluster.

.. [#overloaded-primary-term] The term "primary" in the context of
   databases and sharding, has nothing to do with the term
   :term:`primary` in the context of :term:`replica sets <replica set>`.
