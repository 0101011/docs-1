Delayed Replica Set Members
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Delayed members contain copies of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data
set that reflect an earlier, or delayed, state of the set. For instance,
if a delayed member has a delay of one hour, then at its most recent,
the delayed member's data reflects the primary's data from an hour
earlier. For example, if the current time is 09:52 and a member has a
delay of an hour, no operation on the delayed member will be more recent
than 08:52.

.. note::

   - Delayed members **must be** :ref:`secondary-only
     <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` members to prevent a delayed
     member from becoming a primary.

   - Delayed members **should be** :ref:`hidden
     <replica-set-hidden-members>` to prevent applications from seeing
     or querying this member.

   - Delayed members *do* vote in :term:`elections <election>` for
     primary, even if delayed members **cannot** become a primary.

Because delayed members provide a running "historical" snapshot of the
data set or a rolling backup, they may help recover from various kinds
of human error, such as unintentionally deleted databases and
collections or unsuccessful application upgrades.

Delayed members apply operations from the :term:`oplog` on a delay.
When determining the amount of delay to apply, consider the following
factors:

- Ensure that the length of the delay is equal to or greater than your
  maintenance windows.

- The size of the oplog is sufficient to capture *more than* the
  number of operations that typically occur in that period of
  time. For more information on oplog size, see
  :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`.

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-a-delayed-replica-set-member`.
