:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` provide high availability using
automatic :term:`failover`. Failover allows a :term:`secondary`
member to become :term:`primary` if primary is unavailable. Failover,
in most situations does not require manual intervention.

Replica set members keep the same data set but are otherwise
independent. If the primary becomes unavailable, the replica set holds
an :doc:`election </core/replica-set-elections>` to select a new
primary. In some situations, the failover process may require
a :doc:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`. [#rollback-automatic]_

.. [#rollback-automatic] Replica sets remove "rollback" data when
   needed without intervention. Administrators must apply or discard
   rollback data manually.
