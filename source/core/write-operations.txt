Write Operations

.. default-domain:: mongodb

All operations that create or modify data in the MongoDB instance are
write operations. Write operations target a single
:term:`collection`. All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the
level of a single :term:`document`. No insert, update, or remove can
affect more than one document or more than one collection atomically.
