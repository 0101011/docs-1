.. default-domain:: mongodb

All operations that create or modify data in the MongoDB instance are
write operations. MongoDB represents data as :term:`BSON documents
<document>` stored in :term:`collections <collection>`. Write
operations target one collection and are atomic on the level of a
single document: no single write operation can atomically affect more
than one document or more than one collection.
