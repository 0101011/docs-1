=============================
Replica Set Secondary Members
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

Secondary members contain replicas of the primary's data set. To
replicate the data set, secondary members replicate the primary's
operations log, or :term:`oplog`, and apply these operations to
themselves in an asynchronous process.

Although secondary members cannot accept write operations, they can
accept read operations from client applications. See
:doc:`/core/read-preference` for details on changing the
default read behavior.

If the current primary becomes unavailable, a secondary member can
become the new primary if that secondary receives votes from a majority
in an election. See :doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details.

You can configure different secondary members for different purposes:

- To prevent a secondary from becoming a primary in an election, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-secondary-only-member`.

- To prevent applications from reading from a secondary member, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

- To keep all but the most recent changes on a secondary, for use in
  recovery, see :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`.

- To disable a memberâ€™s ability to vote in elections, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-non-voting-member`.
