=============================
Replica Set Secondary Members
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

Secondary members contain replicas of the primary's dataset. To
replicate the dataset, secondary members replicate the primary's
operations log, or :term:`oplog`, and apply these operations to
themselves in an asynchronous process.

Although secondary members cannot accept write operations, they can
accept read operations from client applications. See
:doc:`/core/read-preference` for details on changing the
default read behavior.

If the current primary becomes unavailable, a secondary member can
become the new primary if that secondary receives votes from a majority
in an election. See :doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details.

A secondary member can have additional configuration to modify its
behavior in the replica set:

- :doc:`/core/replica-set-secondary-only-member` to prevent the
  secondary from becoming a primary in an election,

- :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member` configuration to prevent
  applications from reading from this secondary member,

- :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member` configuration, and

- :doc:`/core/replica-set-non-voting-member` configuration.
