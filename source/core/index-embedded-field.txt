Indexes on Embedded Fields
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can create indexes on fields embedded in sub-documents, just as you
can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields
differ from :ref:`indexes on sub-documents <index-sub-documents>`,
which include the full content up to the maximum :limit:`Index Size` of
the sub-document in the index. Instead, indexes on embedded fields
allow you to use a "dot notation," to introspect into sub-documents.

Consider a collection named ``people`` that holds documents that resemble
the following example document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"_id": ObjectId(...)
    "name": "John Doe"
    "address": {
           "street": "Main"
           "zipcode": 53511
           "state": "WI"
           }
   }

You can create an index on the ``address.zipcode`` field, using the
following specification:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { "address.zipcode": 1 } )
