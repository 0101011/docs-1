In a production cluster, you must ensure that data is redundant and
that your systems are highly available. To that end, a production
cluster must have the following components:

- Three Config Servers
    Each :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` must be on
    separate machines. A single :term:`sharded cluster` must have
    exclusive use of its :ref:`config servers
    <sharding-config-server>`. If you have multiple sharded clusters,
    you will need to have a group of config servers for each cluster.

- Two or More Replica Sets As Shards
    These replica sets are the :term:`shards <shard>`. For information
    on replica sets, see :doc:`/replication`.

- One or More Query Routers (``mongos``)
    The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances are the routers for the cluster.
    Typically, deployments have one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance on each
    application server.

    You may also deploy a group of :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and use
    a proxy/load balancer between the application and the
    :binary:`~bin.mongos`. In these deployments, you *must* configure the
    load balancer for *client affinity* so that every connection from a
    single client reaches the same :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

    Because cursors and other resources are specific to an single
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, each client must interact with only one
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
