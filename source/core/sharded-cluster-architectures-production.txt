Production Cluster Architecture
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In a production cluster, you must ensure that data is redundant and that
your systems are highly available. To that end, a production-level
cluster must have the following components:

- Three :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`, each residing on a
  discrete system.

  A single :term:`sharded cluster` must have exclusive use of its
  :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`. If you have multiple
  sharded clusters, you will need to have a group of config servers
  for each cluster.

- Two or more :term:`replica sets <replica set>` to serve as
  :term:`shards <shard>`. For information on replica sets, see
  :doc:`/replication`.

- Two or more :program:`mongos` instances. Typically, you deploy a
  single :program:`mongos` instance on each application server.
  Alternatively, you may deploy several :program:`mongos` nodes and let
  your application connect to these via a load balancer.
