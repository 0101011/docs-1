These documents present the details of sharding in MongoDB. These
include the components, the architectures, and the behaviors of MongoDB
sharded clusters. For an overview of sharding and sharded clusters, see
:doc:`/core/sharding-introduction`.

   Sharded Cluster Components
   --------------------------

.. only:: website

   .. class:: toc

      :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-components`
         A sharded cluster consists of shards, config servers, and
         :program:`mongos` instances.

   Sharded Cluster Architectures
   -----------------------------

.. only:: website

   .. class:: toc

      :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-architectures`
         Outlines the requirements for sharded clusters, and provides
         examples of several possible architectures for sharded clusters.

   Sharded Cluster Behavior
   ------------------------

.. only:: website

   .. class:: toc

      :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-operations`
         Discusses the operations of sharded clusters with regards to the
         automatic balancing of data in a cluster and other related
         availability and security considerations.

   Sharding Mechanics
   ------------------

.. only:: website

   .. class:: toc

      :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-mechanics`
          Discusses the internal operation and behavior of sharded
          clusters, including chunk migration, balancing, and the cluster
          metadata.
