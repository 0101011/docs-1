Replica Set Members
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Replication is the process of duplicating data from one system to
another. MongoDB provides replication through a configuration of
:program:`mongod` instances in a cluster known as a *replica set*. A
*replica set* can contain the following members:

- :ref:`replica-set-primary-member`, which receives all the write
  operations,

- :ref:`replica-set-secondary-members`, which keep a copy of the
  primary's data set and can have additional configurations, such as
  :ref:`non-voting member <replica-set-non-voting-members>`
  configuration, and

- :ref:`replica-set-arbiters`, which does not keep a copy of the data
  but plays a role in determining a new primary if the current primary
  becomes unavailable.

A replica set can have up to 12 members, but only up to 7 voting
members. The minimum requirements for a replica set is a :ref:`primary
<replica-set-primary-member>`, a :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>`, and an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>`. In most circumstances, however, you will want
to deploy three **data** members with a :ref:`primary
<replica-set-primary-member>`, and two :ref:`secondary members
<replica-set-secondary-members>`.
