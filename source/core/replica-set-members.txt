===================
Replica Set Members
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :program:`mongod` processes
that provide redundancy and high availability. A *replica set* can
contain the following members:

- :ref:`replica-set-primary-member`, which receives all the write
  operations,

- :ref:`replica-set-secondary-members`, which replicate operations from
  the primary to maintain their data set and can have additional
  configurations, such as :ref:`non-voting member
  <replica-set-non-voting-members>` configuration, and

- :ref:`replica-set-arbiters`, which does not keep a copy of the data
  but plays a role in determining a new primary if the current primary
  becomes unavailable.

A replica set can have up to 12 members, [#master-slave]_ but only up
to 7 voting members. The minimum requirements for a replica set is a
:ref:`primary <replica-set-primary-member>`, a :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>`, and an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>`. In most circumstances, however, you will want
to deploy three members that store data; i.e. a
:ref:`primary <replica-set-primary-member>` and two :ref:`secondary
members <replica-set-secondary-members>`.
