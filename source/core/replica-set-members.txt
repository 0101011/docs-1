===================
Replica Set Members
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :program:`mongod` processes
that provide redundancy and high availability. The members of a
replica set are:

- :ref:`replica-set-primary-member`, which receives all the write
  operations. A replica set can have only one primary.

- :ref:`replica-set-secondary-members`, which replicate write
  operations from the primary to synchronize their data sets. If the
  current primary becomes unavailable, a secondary member may become
  the new primary in an election. Secondaries can have additional
  configurations, such as :ref:`non-voting member
  <replica-set-non-voting-members>`.

You can also add an :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` to a replica
set. An arbiter does not keep a copy of the data but votes for a new
primary if the current primary becomes unavailable.

A replica set can have up to 12 members, [#master-slave]_ but only up
to 7 voting members. The minimum requirements for a replica set is a
:ref:`primary <replica-set-primary-member>`, a :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>`, and an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>`. In most cases, however, you will want to have
three members that store data: a :ref:`primary
<replica-set-primary-member>` and two :ref:`secondaries
<replica-set-secondary-members>`.
