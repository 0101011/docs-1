Read operations, or *queries*, retrieve :term:`documents <document>`
from a :term:`collection` in MongoDB. A document is the equivalent of
an :term:`RDBMS` record, and a collection is the equivalent of an RDBMS
table. All queries in MongoDB address a *single* collection.

Read operations in MongoDB is analogous to the SQL ``SELECT``
statement. To specify the selection criteria, MongoDB use a *query
document*. The query documents are :term:`BSON` objects that use a set
of :doc:`query operators </reference/operator>` to specify a condition,
such as equality.

You can also limit which fields to return using a :term:`projection`.
Without a projection, the operation will return all fields of the
documents. Use a projection if your documents are larger, or when your
application only needs a subset of available fields.

The order of documents returned by a query is not defined and is not
necessarily consistent unless you specify a sort (:method:`~cursor.sort()`).

In MongoDB, the :method:`db.collection.find()` method, which returns a
cursor, and the :method:`db.collection.findOne()` method, which returns
a single document, perform read operations.

For examples of queries, see :doc:`/tutorial/query-a-collection` and
:doc:`/tutorial/limit-or-project-fields`.
