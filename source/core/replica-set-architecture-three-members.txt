Three Member Replica Sets
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The minimum *recommended* architecture for a replica set consists of:

- One :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>` and

- Two :doc:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary>` members,
  either of which can become the primary in an :doc:`election
  </core/replica-set-elections>`.

  .. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.rst

  This makes :ref:`failover <replica-set-failover>` possible and ensures
  there exists two full and independent copies of the data set at all
  times. If the primary fails, the replica set elects another member as
  primary and continues replication until the primary recovers.

.. note::

   While not *recommended*, the minimum *supported* configuration for
   replica sets includes one :doc:`primary
   </core/replica-set-primary>`, one :doc:`secondary
   </core/replica-set-secondary>`, and one :doc:`arbiter
   </core/replica-set-arbiter>`. The arbiter requires fewer resources
   and lowers costs but sacrifices operational flexibility and
   redundancy.
