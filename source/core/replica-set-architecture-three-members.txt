Three Member Replica Sets
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The minimum configuration of a replica set is a three member replica
set. 

.. _primary-two-secondary-members:

Primary with Two Secondary Members
----------------------------------

One configuration of three member replica set consists of:

- One :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>` and

- Two :doc:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary>` members,
  either of which can become the primary in an :doc:`election
  </core/replica-set-elections>`.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.rst

Not only does this configuration provide two full and independent
copies of the data set at all times, but ensures :ref:`high
availability <replica-set-failover>` if the primary fails. If the
primary failse, the replica set elects one of the secondary members as
the primary and continues replication until the primary recovers.

Primary with a Secondary and an Arbiter
---------------------------------------

One configuration of three member replica set consists of:

- One :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>`,

- One :doc:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary>` member,
  which can become the primary in an :doc:`election
  </core/replica-set-elections>`, and

- One :doc:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>`, which votes in an
  election.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-secondary-and-arbiter.rst

Since the arbiter does not contain a copy of the data set, this
configuration provides only one full and independent copy of the data
set. Additionally, the arbiter requires fewer resources and lowers
costs.

Although less redundant than the primary with two secondary
architecture, the primary with a secondary and an arbiter configuration
also ensures :ref:`high availability <replica-set-failover>` if the
primary fails. If the primary failse, the replica set elects the
secondary members as the primary.
