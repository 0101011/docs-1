==============================
Non-Voting Replica Set Members
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Non-voting members hold copies of the primary's dataset and can accept
read operations from client applications. Non-voting members do not
vote in elections for a new primary, but a non-voting member **can**
veto an election as well as become the primary.

A replica set can have up to 12 members, but only up to 7 voting
members.
