Non-Voting Replica Set Members
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Non-voting members hold copies of the primary's data set and can accept
read operations from client applications. Non-voting members do not vote
in elections for a new primary, but a non-voting member **can** veto an
election as well as become the primary.

A replica set can have up to 12 members, but only up to 7 voting
members. For instance, the following 9 member replica set has 7 voting
members and 2 non-voting members.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-only-seven-voting-members.rst

A non-voting member has its
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].votes` equal to ``0`` in its
member configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
		"_id" : <num>
		"host" : <hostname:port>,
		"votes" : 0
	}

You may choose to change the number of votes that each member
has in :ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>` for :term:`primary`. In
general and when possible, all members should have only 1 vote. This
prevents intermittent ties, deadlocks, or the wrong members from
becoming primary. Use :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority`
to control which members are more likely to become primary.

To configure a member as non-voting, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-a-non-voting-replica-set-member`.
