Replication Concepts
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To replicate a data set to multiple distinct systems, MongoDB provides
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`. A replica set comprises a primary that receives
write operations and secondaries and other members that replicate the
write operations for redundancy and dedicated operational
profiles. Like replication in any database system, replica sets
increase redundancy, provide high availability, and may broaden the
distribution of read operations. Additionally, with replica sets,
MongoDB automates the administration and operation of replicated
database systems. Replica sets provide the basis of all MongoDB
deployments.
