Replica Set Primary
===================

.. start-content

The primary is the only member in the replica set that receives write
operations. MongoDB applies write operations on the :term:`primary` and
then records the operations on the primary's operations log called the
:term:`oplog`. Other members, called the :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>` members, replicate this log and apply
the operations to themselves in an asynchronous process.

While all members of the replica set can accept read operations, by
default, an application directs its read operations to the primary
member in a replica set. See :doc:`/core/read-preference` for details on
changing the default read behavior.

The replica set can have at most one primary. If the current primary
becomes unavailable, an election determines the new primary. See
:doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details.
