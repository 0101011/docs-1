.. default-domain:: mongodb

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. When constructing
a data model for your MongoDB collection, there are various options
you must choose from, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses.

The following sections guide you through the decisions you will have
to make, and detail various considerations to keep in mind when
choosing the best data model for your application needs.

For a general introduction to data modeling in MontoDB, see the

:doc:`Data Modeling Patterns and Examples
