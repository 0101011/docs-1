===================
Replica Set Arbiter
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

An arbiter does **not** have a copy of the primary's data set and
**cannot** become a primary. An arbiter exists solely to vote in
:ref:`elections of new primary <replica-set-elections>`. An election of
a new primary requires a majority. If your replica set has an even
number of members, you can add an :doc:`arbiter
</tutorial/add-replica-set-arbiter>` to obtain a majority. An arbiter
allows you to construct this majority without the overhead of adding
replicating nodes to the system.

.. warning::

   - Do not run the arbiter on a system that is an active primary
     or secondary of its replica set.

   - To prevent tied :term:`elections <election>`, do not add an
     arbiter to a set if the set already has an odd number of voting
     members.

You can have a three-member replica set with a primary, secondary, and
an arbiter.

For example, in the following replica set, adding an arbiter
allows you to have an odd number of votes to obtain a majority in an
election.

Arbiters have the following interactions with the rest of the replica
set:

- Credential exchanges that authenticate the arbiter with the replica
  set. All MongoDB processes within a replica set use keyfiles. These
  exchanges **are** encrypted.

  MongoDB only transmits the authentication credentials in a
  cryptographically secure exchange and encrypts no other exchange.

- Exchanges of replica set configuration data and of votes. These are
  **not** encrypted.

  If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then all communications between
  arbiters and the other members of the replica set are secure. See the
  documentation :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information. As
  with all MongoDB components, run arbiters on secure networks.
