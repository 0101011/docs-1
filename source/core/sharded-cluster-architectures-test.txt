=========================
Test Cluster Architecture
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can deploy a very minimal cluster for testing and
development. These *non-production* clusters have the following
components:

- One :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`.

- At least one shard (either :term:`replica sets
  <replica set>` or as a standalone :program:`mongod`.)

- One :program:`mongos` instance.

.. warning:: Use the test cluster architecture for testing and development only.
