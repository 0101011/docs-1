=========================
Test Cluster Architecture
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For testing and development, you can deploy a minimal cluster. These
*non-production* clusters have the following components:

- One :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`.

- At least one shard (either a :term:`replica set` or a standalone
  :program:`mongod`.)

- One :program:`mongos` instance.

.. warning:: Use the test cluster architecture for testing and development only.
