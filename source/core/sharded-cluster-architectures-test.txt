.. warning:: Use the test cluster architecture for testing and
   development only.

For testing and development, you can deploy a minimal sharded clusters
cluster. These **non-production** clusters have the following
components:

- One :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`.

- At least one shard. Shards are either :term:`replica sets <replica
  set>` or a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

- One :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
