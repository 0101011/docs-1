===========================
Aggregation Pipeline Limits
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Aggregation operations with the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command have the
following limitations.

Type Restrictions
-----------------

The :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` cannot operate
on values of the following types: ``Symbol``, ``MinKey``, ``MaxKey``,
``DBRef``, ``Code``, ``CodeWScope``.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4
   Removed restriction on ``Binary`` type data. In MongoDB 2.2, the pipeline
   could not operate on ``Binary`` type data.

Result Size Restrictions
------------------------

Output from the pipeline cannot exceed the :limit:`BSON Document Size`
limit, which is currently 16 megabytes. If the result set exceeds this
limit, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command produces an error.

Memory Restrictions
-------------------

If any single aggregation operation consumes more than 10 percent of
system RAM, the operation will produce an error.

Cumulative operators, such as :pipeline:`$sort` and :pipeline:`$group`,
require access to the entire input set before they can produce any
output. These operators log a *warning* if the cumulative operator
consumes 5% or more of the physical memory on the host. Like any
aggregation operation, these operators produce an error if they consume
10% or more of the physical memory on the host. See the
:pipeline:`$sort` and :pipeline:`$group` reference pages for details on
their specific memory requirements and use.
