===========================================
Performance of Write Operations and Indexes
===========================================

After every insert, update, or delete operation, MongoDB must update
*every* index associated with the collection in addition to the data
itself. Therefore, every index on a collection adds some amount of
overhead for the performance of write operations. [#exceptions]_

In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read
operations* are worth the insertion penalty. However, in order to
optimize write performance when possible, be careful when creating new
indexes and evaluate the existing indexes to ensure that your queries
actually use these indexes.

For indexes and queries, see :doc:`/core/query-optimization`. For more
information on indexes, see :doc:`/indexes` and
:doc:`/applications/indexes`.

.. [#exceptions] For inserts and updates to un-indexed fields, the
   overhead for :ref:`sparse indexes <index-type-sparse>` is less than
   for non-sparse indexes. Also for non-sparse indexes, updates that
   do not change the record size have less indexing overhead.
