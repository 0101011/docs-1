Secondary-Only Replica Set Members
==================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Secondary-only members contain copies of the primary's data set and can
accept read operations from client applications. However,
secondary-only members **cannot** become primary in an election. For
example, you may want to configure all members of a replica sets
located outside of the main data centers as secondary-only to prevent
these members from ever becoming primary. 

Secondary-only members also support acting as cold standbys. For some
sets, it may not be possible to initialize a new member in a reasonable
amount of time. In these situations, it may be useful to maintain a
cold standby with an up-to-date copy for the purpose of replacing
another member in the replica set. In most cases, these members can be
ordinary members of the replica set, but in large sets, with varied
hardware availability, or given some patterns of :ref:`geographical
distribution <replica-set-geographical-distribution>`, you may want to
use a secondary-only or a hidden member.

Cold standbys may be valuable when your :term:`primary` and "hot
standby" :term:`secondaries <secondary>` members have a different
hardware specification or connect via a different network than the main
set. In these cases, deploy members as a secondary-only member or a
:ref:`hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>` member to ensure that they
will vote in elections but will never be eligible to become primary.
[#replica-set-vote-limitation]_

Consider likely failover scenarios, such as inter-site network
partitions, and ensure there will be members eligible for election as
primary *and* a quorum of voting members in the main facility.

.. [#replica-set-vote-limitation] If your set already has ``7`` voting
   members, set the :data:`local.system.replset.members[n].votes` value to
   ``0`` for the cold standby members, so that they won't vote in elections.
