Map-Reduce

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides map-reduce operations to handle large and complex
aggregation tasks. In MongoDB, map-reduce operations use custom
JavaScript functions to *map*, or associate, values to a key and to
*reduce* the values for the key to a single object.

Map-reduce provides greater flexibility and capabilities than the
:doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`. But the
complexities of map-reduce make aggregation pipeline the preferred
solution for many aggregation tasks.

To perform map-reduce operations, MongoDB interfaces provides the
:dbcommand:`mapReduce` command. In the :program:`mongo` shell, MongoDB
provides :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` wrapper method.

This section describes map-reduce in MongoDB. For examples of
map-reduce, see :doc:`/applications/aggregation`.
