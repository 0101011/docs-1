*Read* operations retrieve :term:`documents <document>` from a
:term:`collection` in MongoDB. A document is the equivalent of an
:term:`RDBMS` record, and a collection is the equivalent of an RDBMS
table. For general information about read operations and the factors
that affect their performance, see :doc:`/core/read-operations`. For
documentation of the other CRUD operations, see the :doc:`/crud` page.

You can retrieve documents from MongoDB using either of the following
methods:

- :ref:`find <crud-read-find>`

- :ref:`findOne <crud-read-findOne>`

.. _crud-read-find:

``find()``
----------

The :method:`~db.collection.find()` method is the primary method to
select documents from a collection. The :method:`~db.collection.find()`
method returns a cursor that contains a number of documents. Most
:doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` provide application developers
with a native iterable interface for handling cursors and accessing
documents. The :method:`~db.collection.find()` method has the following
syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( <query>, <projection> )

In the :program:`mongo` shell, you can format the output by adding
``.pretty()`` to the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method call.

.. admonition:: Corresponding Operation in SQL

   The :method:`~db.collection.find()` method is analogous to
   the ``SELECT`` statement, while:

   - the ``<query>`` argument corresponds to the ``WHERE`` statement,
     and

   - the ``<projection>`` argument corresponds to the list of fields
     to select from the result set.

For examples, see :method:`~db.collection.find()`.

.. _crud-read-findOne:
.. _crud-read-find-one:

``findOne()``
-------------

The :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method selects a single
document from a collection and returns that document.
:method:`~db.collection.findOne()` does *not* return a cursor.

The :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method has the following
syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.findOne( <query>, <projection> )

Except for the return value, :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method
is quite similar to the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method.
Internally, the :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method is the
:method:`~db.collection.find()` method with a limit of 1.

For examples, see :method:`~db.collection.findOne()`.
