======================================
Replica Sets with Four or More Members
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To increase redundancy or to provide additional resources for
distributing secondary read operations, you can add additional members
to a replica set.

When adding additional members, ensure the following architectural
conditions are true:

- The set has an odd number of voting members. If you have an *even*
  number of voting members, deploy an :ref:`arbiter
  <replica-set-arbiters>` to create an odd number.

  For example, the following replica set requires an arbiter to have
  odd number of voting members.

  .. include:: /images/replica-set-four-members-add-arbiter.rst

- The set has no more than 7 voting members at a time. See
  :ref:`non-voting members <replica-set-non-voting-members>` for more
  information.

  For instance, the following 9 member replica set has 7 voting
  members and 2 non-voting members.

  .. include:: /images/replica-set-only-seven-voting-members.rst

- Members that cannot function as primaries in a :term:`failover` have
  :ref:`secondary-only configuration
  <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.

  For instance, if a member cannot function as a primary because of
  resource or network latency constraints, configure that member to be
  a :ref:`secondary-only member <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.
  For example, in following replica set, the secondary member in the
  third data center is a secondary-only member.

  .. include:: /images/replica-set-three-data-centers.rst  

- A majority of the set's members operate in the main data center.
