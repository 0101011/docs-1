=============================
Replica Set Secondary Members
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

Secondary members store exact copies of the primary's data set. To
replicate the data set, secondary members replicate the primary's
:doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>` and apply these operations to
themselves in an asynchronous process.

For example, the following three-member replica set has two secondary
members that contain copies of the primary's data set.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.rst

Although secondary members cannot accept write operations, they can
accept read operations from client applications. See
:doc:`/core/read-preference` for more information on "read
preferences" which describe how clients direct read operations to
MongoDB deployments.

If the current primary becomes unavailable, a secondary member can
become the new primary as the result of an election if it receives
votes from a majority of the replica set. See
:doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details on elections.

.. start-content-election-example

In the following three member replica set, when the primary becomes
unavailable, an election selects one of the remaining secondaries to
become the new primary.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-trigger-election.rst

.. end-content-election-example

You can configure different secondary members for different purposes:

- To prevent a secondary from becoming a primary in an election, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-priority-0-member`.

- To prevent applications from reading from a secondary member, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

- To keep a running "historical" snapshot for use in recovery from
  certain errors, such as unintentionally deleted databases, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`.
