=============================
Replica Set Secondary Members
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

Secondary members store exact copies of the primary's data set. To
replicate the data set, secondary members replicate the primary's
operations log, or :term:`oplog`, and apply these operations to
themselves in an asynchronous process.

For example, the following three-member replica set has two secondary
members that contain copies of the primary's data set.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.rst

Although secondary members cannot accept write operations, they can
accept read operations from client applications. See
:doc:`/core/read-preference` for more information on "read
preferences" which describe how clients direct read operations to
MongoDB deployments.

If the current primary becomes unavailable, a secondary member can
become the new primary as the result of an election, if it receives
votes from a majority of the replica set. See
:doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details on elections.

In the following three member replica set, when the primary becomes
unavailable, an election selects one of the remaining secondaries to
become the new primary.

.. end-content

You can configure different secondary members for different purposes:

- To prevent a secondary from becoming a primary in an election, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-secondary-only-member`.

- To prevent applications from reading from a secondary member, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

- To keep all but the most recent changes on a secondary, for use in
  recovery, see :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`.

- To disable a memberâ€™s ability to vote in elections, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-non-voting-member`.
