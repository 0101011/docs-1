Replica Set Secondary Members
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

Secondaries maintain replicas of the primary's data set. To replicate
the data set, secondaries replicate the primary's :doc:`oplog
</core/replica-set-oplog>`. They then apply these operations to
themselves in an asynchronous process. A replica set can have one or
more secondaries.

For example, the following three member replica set has two secondary
members. The two secondaries replicate the primary's oplog and apply
the operations to their data sets.

Although secondary members cannot accept write operations, they can
accept read operations from client applications. See
:doc:`/core/read-preference` for more information on how clients direct
read operations to members of the replica set.

If the current primary becomes unavailable, a secondary member can
become the new primary as the result of an election. See
:doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details.

.. start-content-election-example

In the following 3-member replica set, the primary becomes unavailable.
This triggers an election where one of the remaining
secondaries becomes the new primary.

.. end-content-election-example

You can configure individual secondary members for different purposes:

- To prevent a secondary from becoming a primary in an election, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-priority-0-member`.

- To prevent applications from reading from a secondary member, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

- To keep a running "historical" snapshot for use in recovery from
  certain errors, such as unintentionally deleted databases, see
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`.
