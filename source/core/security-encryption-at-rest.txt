.. _Application Level Encryption:

Application Level Encryption
----------------------------

Application Level Encryption provides encryption on a per-field or
per-document basis within the application layer. To encrypt document or
field level data, write custom encryption and decryption routines or
use a commercial solution such as the `Vormetric Data Security
Platform
<http://www.vormetric.com/sites/default/files/sb-MongoDB-Letter-2014-0611.pdf>`_.

.. _Storage Encryption:

Storage Encryption
------------------

Storage Encryption encrypts all MongoDB data on the storage or operating
system to ensure that only authorized processes can access protected
data. A number of third-party libraries can integrate with the operating
system to provide transparent disk-level encryption. For example:

- Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)
    LUKS is available for most Linux distributions. For configuration
    explanation, see the `LUKS documentation from Red Hat`_.

- IBM Guardium Data Encryption
    `IBM Guardium Data Encryption`_ provides support for disk-level
    encryption for Linux and Windows operating systems.

- Vormetric Data Security Platform
    The `Vormetric Data Security Platform`_ provides disk and
    file-level encryption in addition to application level encryption.

- Bitlocker Drive Encryption
    `Bitlocker Drive Encryption`_ is a feature available on Windows
    Server 2008 and 2012 that provides disk encryption.

Properly configured disk encryption, when used alongside good security
policies that protect relevant accounts, passwords, and encryption
keys, can help ensure compliance with standards, including HIPAA,
PCI-DSS, and FERPA.
