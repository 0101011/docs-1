Hidden Replica Set Members
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A hidden member contains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data
set. Hidden members are **invisible** to client applications, and the
:method:`db.isMaster()` method will not display hidden members. A hidden
member is also a :ref:`secondary-only members
<replica-set-secondary-only-members>` and **cannot become primary**.
Hidden members, however, **do vote** in :ref:`elections
<replica-set-elections>`.

Hidden members are ideal for instances that will have significantly
different usage patterns than the other members and require separation
from normal traffic. Since no secondary reads reach hidden members,
hidden members receive no traffic beyond what replication requires.
Typically, hidden members provide reporting, dedicated backups, and
dedicated read-only testing and integration support.

For dedicated backup, ensure that the hidden member is close, from a
networking perspective, to the primary or likely primary. Ensure that
the :term:`replication lag` is minimal or non-existent.

If this member runs with journaling enabled, you can safely use
standard :doc:`block level backup methods
</tutorial/backup-databases-with-filesystem-snapshots>` to create a
backup of this member. Otherwise, if your underlying system does not
support snapshots, you can connect :program:`mongodump` to create a
backup directly from the secondary member. In these cases, use the
:option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option to ensure a consistent
point-in-time dump of the database state. See also :doc:`/core/backups`.

To configure a hidden member, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-a-hidden-replica-set-member`.
