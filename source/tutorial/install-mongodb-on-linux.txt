Install MongoDB on Linux
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Compiled versions of :term:`MongoDB` for use on Linux
provide a simple option for users who cannot use packages.

Download MongoDB
----------------

#. Open a terminal session.

#. Download the latest release, either the 64-bit or the 32-bit
   version.

   a. To download the 64-bit version, type the following command at the
      system prompt:

      .. include:: /includes/install-curl-release-linux-x86_64.rst

   #. Otherwise, to download the 32-bit version, type the following
      command at the system prompt:

      .. include:: /includes/install-curl-release-linux-i686.rst

#. Extract the files from the downloaded archive: 

   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongodb.tgz

   The extracted folder has the name
   :file:`mongodb-linux-[version]`.

   You can find the :program:`mongod` binary, as well as all other
   binaries associated with MongoDB utilities, in the ``bin/``
   directory within the archive.

#. Optional. To move the extracted folder into another location, issue
   the following command at the system prompt:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cp -R -n  mongodb-linux-[version]/ mongodb

#. Optional. To ensure that the downloaded binaries are in your
   ``PATH``, you can modify your ``PATH`` and/or create symbolic links
   to the MongoDB binaries in your :file:`/usr/local/bin` directory
   (:file:`/usr/local/bin` is already in your ``PATH``).

Run MongoDB
-----------

Set Up the Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. start-include-for-enterprise-tutorial

Before you start :program:`mongod` for the first time, you will need
to create the data directory. By default, :program:`mongod` writes
data to the ``/data/db/`` directory. 

#. To create this directory, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir -p /data/db

#. Ensure that the system account that will run the :program:`mongod`
   process has read and write permissions to this directory. For
   example, if :program:`mongod` runs under the ``mongodb`` user
   account, issue the following command to change the owner of this
   folder:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chown mongodb /data/db

You can specify an alternate path for data files using the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option to :program:`mongod`. If
you use an alternate location for your data directory, ensure that this
user can write to the alternate data directory.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start :program:`mongod`, run the executable :program:`mongod` at the
system prompt.

For example, if your ``PATH`` includes the location of the
:program:`mongod` binary, type ``mongod`` at the system prompt.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the :program:`mongod`
binary, type the full path to the :program:`mongod` binary.

The above :program:`mongod` instance writes data to the ``/data/db/``
directory. To specify an alternate data directory, start
:program:`mongod` with the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath <some alternate directory>

Whether using the default :file:`/data/db` or an alternate directory,
ensure that the user account running :program:`mongod` has read and
write permissions to the directory.

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop the :program:`mongod` instance, press ``Control+C`` in the
terminal where the :program:`mongod` instance is running.
