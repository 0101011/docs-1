Install MongoDB on Other Linux Systems
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Compiled versions of MongoDB for Linux provide a simple option for
installing MongoDB for other Linux systems without supported packages.

Installation Process
--------------------

MongoDB provides archives for both 64-bit and 32-bit Linux. Follow the
installation procedure appropriate for your system.

Install for 64-bit Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In a system shell, download the latest release for 64-bit
   [#older-version]_.

   .. include:: /includes/install-curl-release-linux-x86_64.rst

#. Extract the files from the downloaded archive. 

   .. include:: /includes/install-untar-release-linux-x86_64.rst

#. Optional. Copy the extracted folder into another location, such
   as :file:`mongodb`.

   .. include:: /includes/install-copy-release-linux-x86_64.rst

#. Optional. To ensure that the downloaded binaries are in your
   ``PATH``, you can modify your ``PATH`` and/or create symbolic links
   to the MongoDB binaries in your :file:`/usr/local/bin` directory
   (:file:`/usr/local/bin` is already in your ``PATH``). You can find
   the MongoDB binaries in the ``bin/`` directory within the archive.

Install for 32-bit Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In a system shell, download the latest release for 32-bit version
   [#older-version]_.

   .. include:: /includes/install-curl-release-linux-i686.rst

#. Extract the files from the downloaded archive. 

   .. include:: /includes/install-untar-release-linux-i686.rst

#. Optional. Copy the extracted folder into another location, such
   as :file:`mongodb`.

   .. include:: /includes/install-copy-release-linux-i686.rst

#. Optional. To ensure that the downloaded binaries are in your
   ``PATH``, you can modify your ``PATH`` and/or create symbolic links
   to the MongoDB binaries in your :file:`/usr/local/bin` directory
   (:file:`/usr/local/bin` is already in your ``PATH``). You can find
   the MongoDB binaries in the ``bin/`` directory within the archive.

.. [#older-version] You can specify a different version to download.

Run MongoDB
-----------

Set Up the Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. start-include-for-enterprise-tutorial

Before you start :program:`mongod` for the first time, you will need
to create the data directory. By default, :program:`mongod` writes
data to the ``/data/db`` directory. 

#. To create this directory, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir -p /data/db

#. Ensure that the user that runs the :program:`mongod` process has read and
   write permissions to this directory. For example, if you will run the
   :program:`mongod` process, change the owner of the :file:`/data/db`
   directory:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chown mongodb /data/db

You can specify an alternate path for data files using the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option to :program:`mongod`. If
you use an alternate location for your data directory, ensure that this
user can write to the alternate data directory.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start :program:`mongod`, run the executable :program:`mongod` at the
system prompt.

For example, if your ``PATH`` includes the location of the
:program:`mongod` binary, enter ``mongod`` at the system prompt.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the :program:`mongod`
binary, enter the full path to the :program:`mongod` binary.

Starting :program:`mongod` without any arguments starts a MongoDB
instance that writes data to the ``/data/db`` directory. To specify an
alternate data directory, start :program:`mongod` with the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath <some alternate directory>

Whether using the default :file:`/data/db` or an alternate directory,
ensure that the user account running :program:`mongod` has read and
write permissions to the directory.

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop the :program:`mongod` instance, press ``Control+C`` in the
terminal where the :program:`mongod` instance is running.
