=======================================
Configure Non-Voting Replica Set Member
=======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A replica set can have up to 12 members, but only up to 7 voting
members. You may choose to change the number of votes that each member
has in :ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>` for :term:`primary`.

.. start-configuration

To configure a member as non-voting, set its
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].votes` value to ``0``.

For example, to disable the ability to vote in elections for the
fourth, fifth, and sixth replica set members, use the following command
sequence in the :program:`mongo` shell.

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[3].votes = 0
   cfg.members[4].votes = 0
   cfg.members[5].votes = 0
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

.. include:: /includes/fact-rs-conf-array-index.rst

This sequence gives ``0`` votes to the fourth, fifth, and sixth members
of the set according to the order of the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` array in the output of
:method:`rs.conf()`. This setting allows the set to elect these members
as :term:`primary` but does not allow them to vote in elections. Place
voting members so that your designated primary or primaries can reach a
majority of votes in the event of a network partition.

.. include:: /includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst

.. note::

   In general and when possible, all members should have only 1 vote.
   This prevents intermittent ties, deadlocks, or the wrong members
   from becoming primary. Use
   :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` to control which
   members are more likely to become primary.
