Model Tree Structures with Materialized Paths
=============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions
that affect how you model data can affect application performance and
database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-modeling` for a full high
level overview of data modeling in MongoDB.

This document describes a data model that describes a tree-like
structure in MongoDB documents by storing full relationship paths
between documents.

Pattern
-------

.. start-model-tree-structures-include-here

The *Materialized Paths* pattern stores each tree node in a document;
in addition to the tree node, document stores as a string the id(s) of
the node's ancestors or path. Although the *Materialized Paths* pattern
requires additional steps of working with strings and regular
expressions, the pattern also provides more flexibility in working with
the path, such as finding nodes by partial paths.

Consider the following example that models a tree of categories using
*Materialized Paths* ; the path string uses the comma ``,`` as a
delimiter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Books", path: null } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Programming", path: "Books," } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Databases", path: "Books,Programming," } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Languages", path: "Books,Programming," } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "MongoDB", path: "Books,Programming,Databases," } )
   db.categories.insert( { _id: "Postgres", path: "Books,Programming,Databases," } )

- You can query to retrieve the whole tree, sorting by the ``path``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.categories.find().sort( { path: 1 } )

- You can create an index on the field ``path`` to enable fast search
  by the path:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.categories.ensureIndex( { path: 1 } )

- You can use regular expressions on the ``path`` field to find the
  descendants of ``Programming``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.categories.find( { path: /,Programming,/ } )
