===================================
Change Config Servers to WiredTiger
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   WiredTiger is the new default storage engine for MongoDB.

For config servers deployed as 3 mirrored :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances [#csrs-storage]_, this tutorial gives an overview of changing
the storage engine of the :term:`config servers <config server>` to
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`.

.. [#csrs-storage]

   If the config servers are deployed as a :ref:`replica set (CSRS)
   <3.2-rel-notes-sharded-cluster>`, the config servers already use
   WiredTiger.

Procedure
---------

This tutorial assumes that you have three config servers for this
sharded cluster. The three servers are named **first**, **second**, and
**third**, based on their position in the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
:setting:`~sharding.configDB` setting.

.. important::

   During this process, at most only two config servers will be running
   at any given time to ensure that the sharded cluster's metadata is
   **read-only**.
