=================================================
Backup a Small Sharded Cluster with ``mongodump``
=================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If your :term:`sharded cluster` comprises a small collection of data,
you can connect to a :program:`mongos` and issue the
:program:`mongodump` command. You can use this approach if the following
is true:

- It's possible to store the entire backup on one system or on a single
  storage device. Consider both backups of entire instances and
  incremental dumps of data.

- The state of the database at the beginning of the operation is
  not significantly different than the state of the database at the
  end of the backup. 

  Your application must be able to operate given a copy of the data
  that reflects many moments in time. If the data collected by the
  backup operation is not sufficient to restore from, using
  :program:`mongodump` for your back ups is not viable.

- The backup can run and complete without affecting the performance of
  the cluster.

If these conditions are not all true, then this backup method will not
support the needs of your deployment. Read
:ref:`sharded-cluster-backups` for a high-level overview of important
considerations as well as a list of alternate backup tutorials.

Procedure
---------

.. note:: If you use :program:`mongodump` without specifying the a database or
   collection, the output will contain both the collection data and the
   sharding config metadata from the :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`.

   You cannot use the :option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option for
   :program:`mongodump` when dumping from a :program:`mongos`. This option is only
   available when running directly against a :term:`replica set` member.

To perform a backup of a shard cluster by connecting
:program:`mongodump` by connecting directly, use the following
operation a your system's prompt: 

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump --journal --host mongos3.example.net --port 27017

This will create a database dump of the shard cluster accessible via
the :program:`mongos` listening on port ``27017`` of the
``mongos3.example.net`` mongos instance.

The dump produced by this operation will effectively "unshard" your
data: you must re-shard and re-balance the data when you restore.
