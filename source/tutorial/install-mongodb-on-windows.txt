Prerequisites
-------------

Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB requires x86-64 architecture and supports the following:

- Windows 7/Server 2008 R2

- Windows 8/2012 R2 and later

See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more information.

Windows Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Windows 2012 Server and Windows 10 need 
  `KB2999226 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows>`__ 
  to provide Universal C Runtime support for Windows.

- Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 need 
  `KB2731284 <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2731284>`__ to resolve
  an issue with memory mapped files on Windows.

Production Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
:doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

Security
~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

.. warning::

   Do not expose :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` to a public network without 
   :doc:`configuring authentication </core/authentication>`. MongoDB 
   is designed to be run in trusted environments.

         You may install MongoDB |mdb-edition| unattended on Windows 
         from the command line using ``msiexec.exe``.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/install-mongodb-on-windows-unattended.rst

Run |mdb-edition| from the Command Interpreter
------------------------------------------------

Open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`.
 
.. important::

   You must open the command interpreter as an
   :guilabel:`Administrator`.

Run |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------

Start |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set up the MongoDB server as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` that
starts automatically at boot time.

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-manually-windows-service-for-mongodb.rst

Stop |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop/pause the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Stop` (or :guilabel:`Pause`).

You can also stop the MongoDB service from the `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``). Open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:
  
.. code-block:: bat

   net stop MongoDB

Remove |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove the MongoDB service, first use the Services console to stop
the service. Then open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   sc.exe delete MongoDB

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Point Releases and ``.msi``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB with the Windows installer (``.msi``), the
``.msi`` automatically upgrades within the :ref:`same release series
<release-version-numbers>` (e.g. 3.6.0 to 3.6.1).

Upgrading a full release series (e.g. 3.4 to 3.6) requires a new
installation.

Add MongoDB binaries to the System PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All command-line examples in this tutorial are provided as absolute paths to the MongoDB binaries. You can add ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin`` to your System ``PATH`` and then omit the full path to the MongoDB binaries.
