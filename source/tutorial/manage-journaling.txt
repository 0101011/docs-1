MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal` to
guarantee :doc:`write operation </core/write-operations>` durability
and to provide crash resiliency. 

With MMAPv1, before applying a change to the data files, MongoDB writes
the change operation to the journal. If MongoDB should terminate or
encounter an error before it can write the changes from the journal to
the data files, MongoDB can re-apply the write operation and maintain a
consistent state.  By default, the greatest extent of lost
writes, i.e., those not made to the journal, are those made in the last
100 milliseconds. See :setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` for more
information on the default.

With WiredTiger, even without journaling, :ref:`checkpoints
<storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>` provide a consistent view of data on
disk and allow MongoDB to recover from the last checkpoint. However, if
MongoDB exits unexpectedly in between checkpoints, journaling is
required to recover information that occured after the last checkpoint.

Procedures
----------

Enable Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For 64-bit builds of :binary:`~bin.mongod`, journaling is enabled by default.

To enable journaling, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the
:option:`--journal <mongod --journal>` command line option.

Disable Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Do not disable journaling on production systems. If your
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance stops without shutting down cleanly
   unexpectedly for any reason, (e.g. power failure) and you are
   not running with journaling, then you must recover from an
   unaffected :term:`replica set` member or backup, as described in
   :doc:`repair  </tutorial/recover-data-following-unexpected-shutdown>`.

To disable journaling, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the
:option:`--nojournal <mongod --nojournal>` command line option.

Get Commit Acknowledgment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get commit acknowledgment with the
:ref:`write-concern` and the ``j`` option. For details, see
:ref:`write-concern-operation`.

.. _journaling-avoid-preallocation-lag:

Avoid Preallocation Lag for MMAPv1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the :doc:`MMAPv1 storage engine </core/mmapv1>`, MongoDB may
preallocate journal files if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process determines
that it is more efficient to preallocate journal files than create new
journal files as needed.

Depending on your filesystem, you might experience a preallocation lag
the first time you start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance with journaling
enabled. The amount of time required to pre-allocate files might last
several minutes; during this time, you will not be able to connect to
the database. This is a one-time preallocation and does not occur with
future invocations.

To avoid :ref:`preallocation lag <journaling-journal-files>`, you can
preallocate files in the journal directory by copying them from another
instance of :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

Preallocated files do not contain data. It is safe to later remove them.
But if you restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` with journaling, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
will create them again.

.. example:: The following sequence preallocates journal files for an
   instance of :binary:`~bin.mongod` running on port ``27017`` with a database
   path of ``/data/db``.

   For demonstration purposes, the sequence starts by creating a set of
   journal files in the usual way.

   1. Create a temporary directory into which to create a set of journal
      files:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mkdir ~/tmpDbpath

   #. Create a set of journal files by staring a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
      instance that uses the temporary directory:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --port 10000 --dbpath ~/tmpDbpath --journal

   #. When you see the following log output, indicating
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` has the files, press CONTROL+C to stop the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

      .. code-block:: sh

         [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 10000

   #. Preallocate journal files for the new instance of
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` by moving the journal files from the data directory
      of the existing instance to the data directory of the new instance:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mv ~/tmpDbpath/journal /data/db/

   #. Start the new :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db --journal

Monitor Journal Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following command to monitor journal status:

- :dbcommand:`serverStatus`

  The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns database status
  information that is useful for assessing performance.

.. _journaling-journal-commit-interval:

Change the Group Commit Interval for MMAPv1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the :doc:`MMAPv1 storage engine </core/mmapv1>`, you can set the
group commit interval using the :option:`--journalCommitInterval
<mongod --journalCommitInterval>` command line option. The allowed
range is ``2`` to ``300`` milliseconds.

Lower values increase the durability of the journal at the expense of
disk performance.

Recover Data After Unexpected Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a restart after a crash, MongoDB replays all journal files in the
journal directory before the server becomes available. If MongoDB must
replay journal files, :binary:`~bin.mongod` notes these events in the log
output.

There is no reason to run :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` in these
situations.
