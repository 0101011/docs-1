===================================
Configure Hidden Replica Set Member
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Hidden members are part of a :term:`replica set` but cannot become
:term:`primary` and are invisible to client applications. Hidden members
do, however, vote in :ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`. For a
detailed description of hidden members and their purposes, see
:doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-replica-set-sync-prefers-non-hidden.rst

To configure a member as hidden, set its
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value to ``0`` and
set its :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].hidden` value to
``true``.

Example
-------

To configure a :term:`hidden member`, on the :term:`primary`, use the
following sequence of operations in the :program:`mongo` shell. You
identify each member by its array index in the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` array:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].hidden = true
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

.. include:: /includes/fact-rs-conf-array-index.rst

.. include:: /includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst

After re-configuring the set, the first member of the set in the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` array will have a priority of ``0``
so that it cannot become primary. The other members in the set will
not advertise the hidden member in the :dbcommand:`isMaster` or
:method:`db.isMaster()` output.

.. versionchanged:: 2.0
   For :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` running with replica
   sets before 2.0, if you reconfigured a member as hidden, you *had*
   to restart :program:`mongos` to prevent queries from reaching the
   hidden member.
