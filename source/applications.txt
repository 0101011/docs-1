Application Development
=======================

MongoDB provides language-specific client libraries called
:term:`drivers <driver>` that let you develop applications to interact
with your databases.

This page lists the documents, tutorials, and reference pages that
describe application development. For API-level documentation, see
:doc:`/applications/drivers`.

For an overview of topics with which every
MongoDB application developer will want familiarity,
see the :doc:`aggregation </aggregation>` and :doc:`indexes
</indexes>` documents.
For an introduction too basic
MongoDB use, see the :ref:`administration tutorials <administration-tutorials>`.

.. seealso:: :wiki:`Developer Zone <Developer+Zone>` wiki pages and
   the :doc:`/faq/developers` document. Developers also should be
   familiar with :doc:`mongo` and the MongoDB :doc:`query
   and update operators </reference/operators>`.
