=============
Using MongoDB
=============

The resources in this section address topics related to application
development for MongoDB. Most applications interact with MongoDB by
way of client drivers or libraries that provide idiomatic interfaces
to the database in the language of your choosing. The
:doc:`/application/drivers` page contains more information about the
drivers themselves and links to more through API-level documentation.

Beyond the drivers, you may also want to consider the documentation of
the :ref:`aggregation framework` which provides a more natural way to
aggregate data with MongoDB. This manual contains documentation of
both :doc:`aggregation itself </applications/aggregation-framework>`
and the :doc:`aggregation operator </reference/aggregation>`.

Finally this section provides a number of :ref:`tutorials
<application-tutorials>`, including tutorials for :ref:`introductory
application development with Python and MongoDB
<applications-tutorials-python>`, that may help you as you begin to
develop applications with MongoDB.

.. seealso:: ":wiki:`Developer Zone <Developer+Zone>`" wiki pages and
   the ":doc:`/faq/developers`" document. Developers also should be
   familiar with the :doc:`mongo` shell and the MongoDB :ref:`query
   and update operators </reference/operators>`.
