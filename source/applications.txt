=======================
Application Development
=======================

MongoDB provides language-specific client libraries called
:term:`drivers <driver>` that let you develop applications to interact
with your databases.

This page lists the documents, tutorials, and reference pages that
describe application development. For API-level documentation, see
:doc:`/applications/drivers`.

For an overview application-development specific concepts, see the
:doc:`aggregation </aggregation>` and :doc:`indexes </indexes>`
documents.  For an introduction to basic MongoDB use, see the
:ref:`administration tutorials <administration-tutorials>`.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/crud` section and the :doc:`/faq/developers`
   document. Developers should also be familiar with the
   :program:`mongo` shell and the MongoDB :doc:`query and update
   operators </reference/operator>`.

Development Considerations
--------------------------

The following documents outline basic application development documents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   applications/drivers
   core/capped-collections

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   tutorial/expire-data

.. TODO: move above in with TTL stuff when indexing is done?
