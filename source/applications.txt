Application Development
=======================

These documents address application development with MongoDB. Most
applications interact with MongoDB using client libraries (drivers.)
The drivers provide language-specific interfaces to the database for
use in your applications. The :doc:`/applications/drivers` page
contains more information about the drivers themselves and links to
more through API-level documentation.

Also consider the :ref:`administration tutorials
<administration-tutorials>` that provide an introduction to basic
MongoDB use. The :doc:`aggregation </aggregation>` and :doc:`indexes
</indexes>` chapters provide an overview of topics with which every
MongoDB application developer will want familiarity.

.. seealso:: ":wiki:`Developer Zone <Developer+Zone>`" wiki pages and
   the ":doc:`/faq/developers`" document. Developers also should be
   familiar with the :doc:`mongo` shell and the MongoDB :doc:`query
   and update operators </reference/operators>`.
