========================
Database Profiler Output
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The database profiler logs information about read and write operations,
cursor operations, and database commands. To set the level of logging
for the database profiler, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler`.

The database profiler logs data in the ``system.profile`` collection,
which is a :term:`capped collection`. To view the profiler's output,
query this collection.

If you turn on profiling operations on a read-only database, you will still see write
operations in the ``system.profile`` collection because the database
profiler itself performs writes to ``system.profile``.

Example Output
--------------

The following is an example of database profiler output for an update
operation.

Output Reference
----------------

The database profiler reports the following values. The set of values
reported for a given operation depends on the operation:

.. stats:: ts

   The timestamp of the operation.

.. stats:: op

   The type of operation. The possible values are:

   - ``insert``
   - ``query``
   - ``update``
   - ``remove``
   - ``getmore``
   - ``command``

.. stats:: ns

   The :term:`namespace` the operation targets. MongoDB forms
   namespaces using the name of the :term:`database` and the name of
   the :term:`collection`.

.. stats:: query

   The query criteria used.

.. stats:: command

   The command used.

.. stats:: updateobj

   The :ref:`update document <documents-update-actions>` passed in
   during an :doc:`update </applications/update>` operation.

.. stats:: cursorid

   The ID of the cursor accessed by a ``getmore`` operation.

.. stats:: ntoreturn

   The number of documents the operation specified to return. For
   example, the :dbcommand:`profile` command would return one document
   (a results document) so the ``ntoreturn`` value would be ``1``. The
   :method:`limit(5) <cursor.limit()>` command would return five
   documents so the ``ntoreturn`` value would be ``5``.

   If the ``ntoreturn`` value is ``0``, the command did not specify a
   number of documents to return, as would be the case with a simple
   :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` command with no limit
   specified.

.. stats:: ntoskip

   The number of documents the :method:`skip() <cursor.skip()>` method
   specified to skip.

.. stats:: nscanned

   The number of documents that were scanned in the :doc:`index </indexes>` in order to
   carry out the operation.

   In general, if ``nscanned`` is much higher than ``nreturned``, the
   database is scanning many objects to find the target objects.
   Consider creating an index to improve this.

.. stats:: moved

   A value of ``true`` indicates that the update operation moved one or
   more documents to a new location on disk. This is slower than an
   in-place update. This should only happen if the document grows in size.

.. stats:: nmoved

   The number of documents moved on disk by the operation.

.. stats:: nupdated

   The number of documents updated by the operation.

.. stats:: keyUpdates

   The number of :doc:`index </indexes>` keys the update changed. Changing an index key
   carries a small performance cost. The database must remove the old
   key and insert a new key into the B-tree index.

.. stats:: numYield

   The number of times the operation yielded to allow other operations
   to complete. Typically, operations yield when they need access to
   data that MongoDB has not yet fully read into memory. This allows
   other operations that have data in memory to complete while MongoDB
   reads in data for the yielding operation. For more information,
   see :ref:`the FAQ on when operations yield <faq-concurrency-yielding>`.

.. stats:: lockStats

   The time in microseconds the operation spent acquiring and holding
   locks. This field reports data for the following lock types:

   - ``R`` - global read lock
   - ``W`` - global write lock
   - ``r`` - database-specific read lock
   - ``w`` - database-specific write lock

   .. stats:: lockStats.timeLockedMicros

      The time in microseconds the operation held a specific lock.

   .. stats:: lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros

      The time in microseconds the operation spent waiting to acquire a
      specific lock.

.. stats:: nreturned

   The number of documents returned by the operation.

.. stats:: responseLength

   The length in bytes of the operation's result document. A large
   ``responseLength`` can affect performance. To limit the size of a the
   result document for a query operation, you can use any of the
   following:

   - :ref:`Projections <read-operations-projection>`
   - :method:`The limit() method <cursor.limit()>`
   - :method:`The batchSize() method <cursor.batchSize()>`

.. stats:: millis

   The time in milliseconds for the server to perform the operation.
   This time does not include network time nor time to acquire the lock.

.. stats:: client

   The IP address or hostname of the client connection where the
   operation originates.

   For some commands, such as :method:`db.eval()`, the client is
   ``0.0.0.0:0`` instead of an actual client.

.. stats:: user

   The authenticated user who ran the operation.

.. todo Test what values appear for authenticated users and add that info.
   When we do, we can add back this: "If the operation was not run by an
   authenticated user, this field's value is an empty string."

.. todo Consider adding documentation to our manual on the
   "internal user" used by replication
