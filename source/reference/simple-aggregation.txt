=====================================
Single Purpose Aggregation Operations
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In addition to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation>` and
:doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>`, MongoDB provides a collection of
specific data aggregation operations to support a number of common data
aggregation functions. These operations include returning counts of
documents, distinct values of a field, or simple grouping operations.

Dedicated to a single functionality, these commands and methods provide
less flexibility than the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation>` and :doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>`.

Count
-----

To provide a count of documents of a collection that match a query
criteria, MongoDB offers the following command and methods to provide
``count`` functionality: the :doc:`/reference/command/count` command,
and for the :program:`mongo` shell, the wrapper methods
:doc:`/reference/method/db.collection.count` and
:doc:`/reference/method/cursor.count`.

Distinct
--------

To return the distinct values of a field from documents that match a
query criteria, MongoDB offers the following command and method:
:doc:`/reference/command/distinct` command, and for the
:program:`mongo` shell, the wrapper method
:doc:`/reference/method/db.collection.distinct`.

Group
-----

To return values grouped by a field or fields from documents that match
a query criteria, MongoDB offers the following command and method:
:doc:`/reference/command/group` command, and for the :program:`mongo`
