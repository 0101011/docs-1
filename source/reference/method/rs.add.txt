.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: rs.add(hostspec,arbiterOnly)

   Specify one of the following forms:

   :param string host: Either a string or a document.  If a string,
                       specifies a host (and optionally port-number)
                       for a new host member for the replica
                       set; MongoDB will add this host with the
                       default configuration. If a document, specifies
                       any attributes about a member of a replica set.

   :param Boolean arbiterOnly: Optional. If ``true``, this host is an
                               arbiter. If the second argument
                               evaluates to ``true``, as is the case
                               with some :term:`documents <document>`,
                               then this instance will become an
                               arbiter.

   Provides a simple method to add a member to an existing
   :term:`replica set`. You can specify new hosts in one of two ways:
   
   #. as a "hostname" with an optional port number to use the default
      configuration as in the :ref:`replica-set-add-member` example.

   #. as a configuration :term:`document`, as in the
      :ref:`replica-set-add-member-alternate-procedure` example.

   This function will disconnect the shell briefly and forces a
   reconnection as the replica set renegotiates which node
   will be :term:`primary`. As a result, the shell will display an
   error even if this command succeeds.

   :method:`rs.add()` provides a wrapper around some of the
   functionality of the ":dbcommand:`replSetReconfig`" :term:`database
   command` and the corresponding shell helper
   :method:`rs.reconfig()`. See the :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration` 
   document for full documentation of all replica set configuration
   options.
