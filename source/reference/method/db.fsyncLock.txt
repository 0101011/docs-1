.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.fsyncLock()

   Forces the database to flush all write operations to the disk and
   locks the database to prevent additional writes until the user
   releases the lock with the :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`
   command. :method:`db.fsyncLock()` is an administrative command.

   This command provides a simple wrapper around a
   :dbcommand:`fsync` database command with the following
   syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { fsync: 1, lock: true }

   This function locks the database and create a window for
   :doc:`backup operations </administration/backups>`.
