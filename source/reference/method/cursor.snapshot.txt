cursor.snapshot()

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.snapshot()

   Append the :method:`cursor.snapshot()` method to a cursor to toggle the
   "snapshot" mode. This ensures that the query will not miss any
   documents and return no duplicates, even if other operations modify
   objects while the query runs.

   .. note::

      You must apply :method:`cursor.snapshot()` to the cursor before
      retrieving any documents from the database.

   Queries with results of less than 1 megabyte are effectively
   implicitly snapshotted.
