.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: sh.addShard(host)

   :param string host: Specify the hostname of a database instance or a
                       replica set configuration.


   Use this method to add a database instance or replica set to a
   :term:`sharded cluster`.
   This method must be run on a :program:`mongos` instance.
   The :param:`host` parameter can be in any of the following forms:

        [hostname]
        [hostname]:[port]
        [set]/[hostname]
        [set]/[hostname],[hostname]:port

   You can specify shards using the hostname, or a hostname and port
   combination if the shard is running on a non-standard port.

   The optimal configuration is to deploy shards across
   :term:`replica sets <replica set>`.
   To add a shard on a replica set you must specify the name of the
   replica set and the hostname of at least one member of the replica
   set.  You can specify all of the hostnames, but at least one member
   must be specified.

   This method is a helper for the :dbcommand:`addShard` command.
   The :dbcommand:`addShard` command has additional options which are
   not available in this method.
