.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.eval(function, arguments)

   :param JavaScript function: A JavaScript function.

   :param arguments: A list of arguments to pass to the JavaScript
                     function.

   Provides the ability to run JavaScript code using the JavaScript
   engine embedded in the MongoDB instance. In this environment the
   value of the ``db`` variable on the server is the name of the
   current database.

   Unless you use :method:`db.eval()`, the :program:`mongo` shell
   itself will evaluate all JavaScript entered into :program:`mongo`
   shell itself.

   .. warning::

      Do not use :method:`db.eval()` for long running operations, as
      :method:`db.eval()` blocks all other operations. Consider using
      :term:`map-reduce` for similar functionality in these
      situations.

      The :method:`db.eval()` method cannot operate on sharded
      data. However, you may use :method:`db.eval()` with non-sharded
      collections and databases stored in :term:`shard cluster`.
