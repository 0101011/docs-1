cursor.batchSize()
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.batchSize()

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method specifies the
   number of documents the cursor will return in each batch. In most
   cases, the effect of configuring the batch size will not affect the
   user or application.

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method takes the
   following parameter:

   :param size:

          The number of documents to return per batch. This value
          also affects whether to close the cursor after the first
          batch. Refer to the specific driver ``batchSize``
          documentation for the cursor behavior as determined by the
          ``size``.

   The :program:`mongo` shell will iterate over 20 documents
   regardless of the configured batch size, unless you specify a
   negative batch size.

   Consider the following examples that use the :method:`batchSize()
   <cursor.batchSize()>` method in the :program:`mongo` shell:

   - Set the number of documents returned by the :method:`find()
     <db.collection.find()>` method to ``10`` per each batch:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        var curs = db.animals.find().batchSize(10)

     The cursor remains open so that you can iterate through the cursor
     ``curs`` to access all documents in the ``animals`` collection.

   - Set the number of documents returned by the :method:`find()
     <db.collection.find()>` method to ``10`` per each batch and close
     after the first batch:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        var curs = db.animals.find().batchSize(-10)

     In the :program:`mongo` shell, the cursor closes after the first
     batch so that you can iterate the cursor only ``10`` times.
