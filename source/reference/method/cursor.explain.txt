.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.explain()

   :returns: A document that describes the process used to return the
             query.

   This method may provide useful insight when attempting to optimize
   a query. When you call the :method:`explain <cursor.explain()>` on
   a query, the query system reevaluates the query plan. As a result,
   these operations only provide a realistic account of *how* MongoDB
   would perform the query, and *not* how long the query would take.

   .. seealso:: :operator:`$explain` for related functionality and
      the ":wiki:`Optimization`" wiki page for information regarding
      optimization strategies.
