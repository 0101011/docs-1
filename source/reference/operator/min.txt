.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $min

   Specify a :operator:`$min` value to specify a lower boundary for
   the value of a field. :program:`mongod` enforces this boundary with
   an index of the field.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { [QUERY] } )._addSpecial("$min" , { value : 20})

   This operation above limits the documents returned to those that
   match the query described by ``[QUERY]`` where the field
   ``value`` is at least ``20``. :program:`mongod` infers the
   index based on the ``query`` unless specified by the
   :method:`cursor.hint()` function.

   Use operation alone or in conjunction with :operator:`$max`
   to limit results to a specific range.

   .. note::

      In most cases, you should avoid this operator in favor of
      :operator:`$gte`.
