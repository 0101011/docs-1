.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $min

   Specify a :operator:`$min` value to specify the *inclusive* lower
   bound for a specific index in order to constrain the results of
   :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>`. Consider the following
   operations on a collection named ``collection`` that has an index
   ``{ age: 1 }``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find()._addSpecial("$min" , { age : 20 } )
      db.collection.find( { $query: {}, $min: { age: 20 } } )

   These are equivalent to the following :method:`cursor.min()` method that
   may be more familiar to you:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find().min( { age: 20 } )
      
   These operations limits the query to those documents where the field
   ``age`` is at least ``20`` using the index ``{ age: 1 }``. You can
   explicitly specify the particular index with :operator:`$hint`.
   Otherwise, MongoDB selects the index using the fields in the
   ``indexbounds``; however, if multiple indexes exist on same fields
   with different sort orders, the selection of the index may be
   ambiguous.

   Use operation alone or in conjunction with :operator:`$max` to limit
   results to a specific range for the same index.

   .. note::

      In most cases, you should avoid this operator in favor of
      :operator:`$gte`.
