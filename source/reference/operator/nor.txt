.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $nor

   The :operator:`$nor` operators provides a Boolean ``NOR`` expression in
   queries. :operator:`$nor` is the functional inverse of :operator:`$or`. Use
   :operator:`$nor` to exclude documents that have fields with specific
   values. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $nor [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that have *neither* a
   ``key1`` field with ``value1`` *nor* a ``key2`` field with
   ``value2``.
