$all

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $all

   The :operator:`$all` operator matches a minimum set of elements that must
   be present in a document's ``field``, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $all: [ 1, 2 , 3 ] } } );

   This returns all documents in ``collection`` where the value of
   ``field`` is an array that is equivalent to or a superset of ``[
   1, 2, 3, ]``. The :operator:`$all` operator will not return any arrays
   that are subsets; for example, the above query matches ``{ field: [
   1, 2, 3, 4] }`` but not ``{ field: [ 2, 3 ] }``.

   .. note::

      In most cases, MongoDB does not treat arrays as sets. This
      operator provides a notable exception to this general approach
