.. operator:: $or

   .. versionadded:: 1.6

   The :operator:`$or` operator provides a Boolean ``OR`` expression in
   queries. Use :operator:`$or` to match documents against two or more
   expressions. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $or [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that *either* have a
   ``key1`` field with ``value1`` *or* a ``key2`` field with ``value2``.

   You may specify a field and then use the :operator:`$or` operator to
   further narrow results. Consider the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { age: "19", $or [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` with an ``age``
   field that has the value ``19``, and *either* a ``key1`` field with
   ``value1`` *or* a ``key2`` field with ``value2``.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0
      You may nest :operator:`$or` operations; however, these
      expressions are not as efficiently optimized as top-level
      :operator:`$or` operations.
