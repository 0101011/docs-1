$maxScan
========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $maxScan

   Constrains the query to only scan the specified number of documents
   when fulfilling the query. Use the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find()._addSpecial( "$maxScan" , 50 )

   Use this modifier to prevent potentially long running queries from
   disrupting performance by scanning through too much data.
