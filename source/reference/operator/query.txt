.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $query

   The :operator:`$query` operator provides an interface to describe
   queries. Consider the following operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $query: { age : 25 } } )

   .. note:: 
   
      You cannot mix these two forms. If you use the $query format do not add extra
      method calls at the end, like ".explain()". Once you start using the $options
      then you must stick with that format. If you want to use $query and do an
      explain, you must use $explain within the "find()"
   
      .. code-block:: javascript

           db.collection.find( { $query: { age : 25 }, $explain: true } )

   This is equivalent to the following :method:`db.collection.find()` method that
   may be more familiar to you:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { age : 25 } )

   These operations return only those documents in the collection named
   ``collection`` where the ``age`` field equals ``25``.
