.. operator:: $regex

   The :operator:`$regex` operator provides regular expression
   capabilities in queries. MongoDB uses Perl compatible regular
   expressions (i.e. "PCRE."))The following examples are equivalent:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: /acme.*corp/i } );
      db.collection.find( { field: { $regex: 'acme.*corp', $options: 'i' } } );

   These expressions match all documents in ``collection`` where the
   value of ``field`` matches the case-insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp``.

   :operator:`$regex` uses "Perl Compatible Regular Expressions" (PCRE) as the
   matching engine.

   .. operator:: $options

     :operator:`$regex` provides four option flags:

     - ``i`` toggles case insensitivity, and allows all letters in the
       pattern to match upper and lower cases.

     - ``m`` toggles multiline regular expression. Without this option,
       all regular expression match within one line.

       If there are no newline characters (e.g. ``\n``) or no
       start/end of line construct, the ``m`` option has no effect.

     - ``x`` toggles an "extended" capability. When set,
       :operator:`$regex` ignores all white space characters unless
       escaped or included in a character class.

       Additionally, it ignores characters between an un-escaped ``#``
       character and the next new line, so that you may include
       comments in complicated patterns. This only applies to data
       characters; white space characters may never appear within
       special character sequences in a pattern.

       The ``x`` option does not affect the handling of the VT character
       (i.e. code 11.)

     .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

     - ``s`` allows the dot (e.g. ``.``) character to match all
       characters *including* newline characters.

     :operator:`$regex` only provides the ``i`` and ``m`` options in the
     short JavaScript syntax (i.e. ``/acme.*corp/i``). To use ``x``
     and ``s`` you must use the ":operator:`$regex`" operator with the
     ":operator:`$options`" syntax.

   To combine a regular expression match with other operators, you
   need to specify the ":operator:`$regex`" operator. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: $regex: /acme.*corp/i, $nin: [ 'acmeblahcorp' } );

   This expression returns all instances of ``field`` in
   ``collection`` that match the case insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp`` that *don't* match ``acmeblahcorp``.

   :operator:`$regex` uses :term:`indexes <index>` only when the
   regular expression has an anchor for the beginning (i.e. ``^``)
   of a string. Additionally, while ``/^a/``, ``/^a.*/``, and
   ``/^a.*$/`` are equivalent, they have different performance
   characteristics. All of these expressions use an index if an
   appropriate index exists; however, ``/^a.*/``, and ``/^a.*$/``
   are slower. ``/^a/`` can stop scanning after matching the prefix.
