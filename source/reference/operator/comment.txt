.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $comment

   The :operator:`$comment` makes it possible to attach a comment to a
   query. Because these comments propagate to the
   :dbcommand:`profile` log, adding :operator:`$comment` modifiers can
   make your profile data much easier to interpret and trace. Consider
   the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find()._addSpecial( "$comment" , "[COMMENT]" )

   Here, ``[COMMENT]`` represents the text of the comment.
