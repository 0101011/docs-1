.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $mod

   The :operator:`$mod` operator performs a fast "modulo" query, to
   reduce the need for expensive :operator:`$where` operator in some
   cases. :operator:`$mod` performs a modulo operation on the value of
   a field, and returns all documents that with the specified remainder value. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $mod: [ d, m ] } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` with a remainder of ``m``,
   with a divisor of ``d``. This replaces the following
   :operator:`$where` operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( "field % d == m" );
