$max

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $max

   Specify a :operator:`$max` value to specify an upper boundary for
   the value of a field. :program:`mongod` enforces this boundary with
   an index of that field.

   .. code-block:: javascript

       db.collection.find()._addSpecial("$max" , { value : 100 })

   This operation above limits the documents returned to those that
   match the query described by ``[QUERY]`` where the field
   ``value`` is less than ``20``. :program:`mongod` infers the
   index based on on the ``query`` unless specified by the
   :method:`cursor.hint()` function.

   Use operation alone or in conjunction with :operator:`$min`
   to limit results to a specific range.

   .. note::

      In most cases, you should avoid this operator in favor of
      :operator:`$lt`.
