$snapshot
=========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $snapshot

   The :operator:`$snapshot` operator ensures that the results
   returned by a query:

   - contains no duplicates.
   - misses no objects.
   - returns all matching objects that were present at the beginning
     and the end of the query.

   Snapshot mode does not guarantee the inclusion (or omission) of an
   object present at the beginning of the query but not at the end
   (due to an update.) Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.foo.find()._addSpecial( "$snapshot", true )

   The JavaScript function :method:`cursor.snapshot()` provides equivalent
   functionality in the :program:`mongo` shell. See the following
   example, which is equivalent to the above:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.foo.find().snapshot()

   Do not use snapshot with :operator:`$hint`, or :operator:`$orderby`
   (:method:`cursor.sort()`.)
