.. operator:: $rename

   *Syntax*: ``{$rename: { <old name1>: <new name1>, <old name2>: <new name2>, ... } }``

   The :operator:`$rename` operator updates the name of a field. The
   new field name must differ from the existing field name.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'nickname': 'alias', 'cell': 'mobile' } } )

   This operation The query renames the field ``nickname`` to ``alias``, and the
   field ``cell`` to ``mobile``.

   If the document already has a field with *new* field name,
   :operator:`$rename` renames the field with the *old* field name to
   the new field name, and removes the previous field with the "*new*"
   field name.
   
   The :operator:`$rename` operator will expand arrays and
   sub-documents to find a match for field names. When renaming a field
   in a sub-document to another sub-document or to a regular field, the
   sub-document itself remains.
   
   Consider the following examples involving the sub-document of the
   following document:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      { "_id": 1,
        "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
        "mobile": "555-555-5555", 
        "nmae": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
      }

   - To rename a sub-document, call the :operator:`$rename` operator
     with the name of the sub-document as you would any other field:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "nmae": "name" } } )
     
     The query renames the sub-document ``nmae`` to ``name``:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript

        { "_id": 1,
          "alias": [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
          "mobile": "555-555-5555",
          "name": { "first" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
        }

   - To rename a field within a sub-document, call the
     :operator:`$rename` operator using the :wiki:`dot notation
     <Dot+Notation+(Reaching+into+Objects)>` to refer to the field.
     Include the name of the sub-document in the new field name to
     ensure the field remains in the sub-document:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "name.first": "name.fname" } } )
     
     The query renames the sub-document field ``first`` to ``fname``:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        { "_id" : 1, 
          "alias" : [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
          "mobile" : "555-555-5555",
          "name" : { "fname" : "george", "last" : "washington" }
        }
    
   - To rename a field within a sub-document and move it to another
     sub-document, call the :operator:`$rename` operator using the
     :wiki:`dot notation <Dot+Notation+(Reaching+into+Objects)>` to
     refer to the field. Include the name of the new sub-document in
     the ``new name``:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { "name.last": "contact.lname" } } )

     The query renames the sub-document field ``last`` to ``lname`` and
     moves it to the sub-document ``contact``:
          
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        { "_id" : 1, 
          "alias" : [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ],
          "contact" : { "lname" : "washington" },
          "mobile" : "555-555-5555",
          "name" : { "fname" : "george" }
        }
      
     If the new field name does not include a sub-document name, the
     field moves out of the subdocument and becomes a regular document
     field.
   
   Consider the following behavior when the specified old field name does not exist:
   
   - When renaming a single field and the old field name refers to a
     non-existing field, the :operator:`$rename` operator does
     nothing, as in the following:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'spouse' } } )

     The above query performs no action since the field with the name
     ``wife`` does not exist.

   - When renaming multiple fields and **all** of the old field names refer to
     non-existing fields, the :operator:`$rename` operator does
     nothing, as in the following:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'spouse', 'vice': 'vp', 'office': 'term' } } )

     The above query performs no action since fields with the name
     ``wife``, ``vice``, and ``office`` do not exist.
      
   - When renaming multiple fields and **some** but not all ``old names``
     refer to non-existing fields, the :operator:`$rename` operator
     performs the following operations:
     
     .. versionchanged:: 2.2

     - Renames the fields that exist to the specified new field names.
     
     - In version 2.2, :operator:`$rename` ignores the non-existing fields.
     
     - Before 2.2: 
     
       - **if** no field exists with the new field name,
         :operator:`$rename` does nothing to any field.

       - **if** fields already exist with the new field names,
         :operator:`$rename` drops these fields.
       
     Consider the following query that renames both an existing field
     ``mobile`` and a non-existing field ``wife``. The field named
     ``wife`` does not exist and :operator:`$rename` sets the field to
     a name that already exists ``alias``.
     
     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.students.update( { _id: 1 }, { $rename: { 'wife': 'alias', 'mobile': 'cell' } } )

     In version 2.2, the operation renames the ``mobile`` field to
     ``cell``. No other action occurs.
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        { "_id" : 1, 
          "alias" : [ "The American Cincinnatus", "The American Fabius" ], 
          "cell" : "555-555-5555", 
          "name" : { "lname" : "washington" }, 
          "places" : { "d" : "Mt Vernon", "b" : "Colonial Beach" } 
        }
     
     Before 2.2, the operation would rename the field ``mobile`` to
     ``cell``. The operation drops the ``alias`` field even though the
     field ``wife`` does not exist:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        { "_id" : 1, 
          "cell" : "555-555-5555", 
          "name" : { "lname" : "washington" }, 
          "places" : { "d" : "Mt Vernon", "b" : "Colonial Beach" } 
        }
   
   .. versionadded:: 1.7.2
