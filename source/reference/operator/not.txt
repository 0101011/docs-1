.. operator:: $not

   :operator:`$not` is a meta operator used to reverse the operation
   of a standard operator. If a document does not match a query statement,
   passing that query statement to the :operator:`$not` will return
   that document. The operation of :operator:`$not` is consistent with
   the behavior of other operators, but may yield unexpected results
   with some data types, like arrays.

   :operator:`$not` only affects *other operators*, and is unable to
   check fields and documents independently. Use :operator:`$ne` to
   test the contents of fields directly and :operator:`$nor` for
   logical disjunctions.

   Consider the following example of :operator:`$not`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $not: { $type: 2 } } } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` where ``field``
   is *not* a string, using the :operator:`$type` operator.

   .. note::

      The :operator:`$not` operator does not support operations with
      :operator:`$regex`.

      When using :operator:`$not`, pass all regular expressions using
      the native BSON type. For example, consider the following
      expression fragment  in Python, using the PyMongo driver:

      .. code-block:: python

        { "$not": re.compile("acme.*corp")}

   .. see:: The :operator:`$type` operator, used in the above example.
