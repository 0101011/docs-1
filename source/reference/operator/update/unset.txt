$unset

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $unset

   The :operator:`$unset` operator deletes a particular field. Consider the
   following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value1 }, { $unset: { field1: "" } } );

   The above example deletes ``field1`` in ``collection`` from
   documents where ``field`` has a value of ``value1``. The value of the field 
   in the :operator:`$unset` statement (i.e. ``""`` above) does not impact 
   the operation.

   If documents match the initial query (e.g. ``{ field: value1 }``
   above) but do not have the field specified in the :operator:`$unset`
   operation (e.g. ``field1``), then the statement has no effect on
   the document.
