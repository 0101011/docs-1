.. operator:: $and

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   The :operator:`$and` operator provides a Boolean ``AND`` expression in
   queries. Use :operator:`$and` to return the documents that satisfy *all*
   included expressions. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $and [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that have *both* a
   ``key1`` field with ``value1`` *and* a ``key2`` field with
   ``value2``.
