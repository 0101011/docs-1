.. operator:: $push

   The :operator:`$push` operator appends a specified value to an array. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $push: { field: value1 } } );

   Here, :operator:`$push` appends ``value1`` to the array identified by
   ``value`` in ``field``. Be aware of the following behaviors:

   - If the field specified in the :operator:`$push` statement
     (e.g. ``{ $push: { field: value1 } }``) does not exist in the
     matched document, the operation adds a new array with the
     specified field and value (e.g. ``value1``) to the matched
     document.

   - The operation will fail if the field specified in the
     :operator:`$push` statement is *not* an array. :operator:`$push`
     does not fail when pushing a value to a non-existent field.

   - If ``value1`` is an array itself, :operator:`$push` appends the whole array as an
     element in the identified array. To add multiple items to an
     array, use :operator:`$pushAll`.
