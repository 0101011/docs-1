$geoNear (aggregation)
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $geoNear

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   :pipeline:`$geoNear` returns documents in order of nearest to
   farthest from a specified point and pass the documents through the
   aggregation :term:`pipeline`. You can only use :pipeline:`$geoNear`
   as the first stage of a pipeline.

   The :pipeline:`$geoNear` operator accepts a :term:`document` that
   contains the following fields. Specify all distances in the same
   units as those of the processed documents' coordinate system:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/pipeline-geoNear-field.rst

Behavior
--------

When using :pipeline:`$geoNear`, consider that:

- You must include the ``distanceField`` option. The
  ``distanceField`` option specifies the field that will contain
  the calculated distance.

- The collection must have a :doc:`geospatial index
  </core/geospatial-indexes>`.

- The :pipeline:`$geoNear` requires that a collection have *at most*
  only one :doc:`2d index </core/2d>` and/or only one
  :doc:`2dsphere index </core/2dsphere>`.

- If using a :doc:`2dsphere index </core/2dsphere>`, you must
  specify ``spherical: true``.

The options for :pipeline:`$geoNear` are similar to the
:dbcommand:`geoNear` command with the following exceptions:

- ``distanceField`` is a mandatory field for the
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator; the option does not
  exist in the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command.

- ``includeLocs`` accepts a ``string`` in the
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator and a ``boolean`` in the
  :dbcommand:`geoNear` command.

Example
-------

Consider a collection ``places`` that has a ``2dsphere`` index. The following
aggregation finds at most ``5`` unique documents with a location at
most 2 units from the center ``[ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ]`` and have ``type`` equal
to ``public``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate([
       {
         $geoNear: {
            near : { type : "Point", coordinates : [ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ] },
            distanceField: "dist.calculated",
            maxDistance: 2,
            query: { type: "public" },
            includeLocs: "dist.location",
            uniqueDocs: true,
            num: 5,
            spherical: true
         }
       }
   ])

The aggregation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "result" : [
         {
           "_id" : 8,
           "name" : "Sara D. Roosevelt Park",
           "type" : "public",
           "location" : {
               "type" : "Point",
               "coordinates" : [ -73.9928, 40.7193 ]
            },
            "dist" : {
               "calculated" : 0.9546646278778689,
               "location" : {
                  "type": "Point",
                  "coordinates" : [ -73.9928, 40.7193 ]
               }
            }
         }
      ],
      "ok" : 1
   }

The document in the ``result`` array contains two new fields:

- ``dist.calculated`` field that contains the calculated distance, and

- ``dist.location`` field that contains the location used in the
  calculation.
