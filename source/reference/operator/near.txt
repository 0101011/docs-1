$near

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $near

   The :operator:`$near` operator takes an argument, coordinates in
   the form of ``[x, y]``, and returns a list of objects sorted
   by distance from those coordinates. See the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { location: { $near: [100,100] } } );

   This query will return 100 ordered records with a ``location``
   field in ``collection``. Specify a different limit using the
   :method:`cursor.limit()`, or another :ref:`geolocation operator
   <geolocation-operators>`, or a non-geospatial operator to limit the
   results of the query.

   .. note:: 
   
      Specifying a batch size (i.e. :method:`batchSize()
      <cursor.batchSize()>`) in conjunction with queries that use the
      :operator:`$near` is not undefined. See :issue:`SERVER-5236` for
      more information.
