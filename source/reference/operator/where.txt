.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $where

   Use the :operator:`$where` operator to pass a string containing a
   JavaScript expression to the query system to provide greater
   flexibility with queries. Consider the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $where: "this.a == this.b" } );

   .. warning::

      :operator:`$where` evaluates JavaScript and cannot take
      advantage of indexes.  Therefore, query performance improves
      when you express your query using the standard MongoDB operators
      (e.g., :operator:`$gt`, :operator:`$in`).

      In general, you should use :operator:`$where` only when you
      can't express your query using another operator.  If you must
      use :operator:`$where`, try to include at least one other
      standard query operator to filter the result set. Using
      :operator:`$where` alone requires a table scan.
