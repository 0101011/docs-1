$elemMatch (projection)
=======================

.. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/operator/elemMatch`

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. projection:: $elemMatch

   Use the :projection:`$elemMatch` projection operator to limit the
   response of a query to a single matching element of an
   array. Consider the following:

   .. example:: 

      Given the following document fragment: 
      
      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         {
          _id: ObjectId(),
          zipcode: <number>
          dependents: [
                       { name: <string>, school: <number>, age: <number> },
                       { name: <string>, school: <number>, age: <number> },
                       { name: <string>, school: <number>, age: <number> }
                      ]
         }
     
      Consider the following :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` 
      operation:

      .. code-block:: javascript
   
         db.students.find( { zipcode: 63109 }, 
                           { _id: 0, 
                             dependents: { $elemMatch: { school: 102 } } } )

      The query would return all documents where the value of the
      ``zipcode`` field is ``63109``, while the projection excludes
      the ``_id`` field and only includes those elements of the
      ``dependents`` array where the ``school`` element has a vale of
      ``102``. The documents would take the following form:
   
      .. code-block:: javascript
       
         {
          dependents: [
                       { name: <string>, school: 102, age: <number> },
                       { name: <string>, school: 102, age: <number> }
                      ]
         }
