.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.2

For the WiredTiger storage engine, MongoDB 3.2 introduces the
``readConcern`` option for replica sets and replica set shards. The
``readConcern`` option allows clients to choose a level of isolation
for their reads. 

``readConcern`` requires MongoDB drivers updated for 3.2.

``readConcern`` Levels
----------------------

By default, MongoDB uses a ``readConcern`` of ``"local"`` which does not
guarantee that the read data would not be rolled back.

You can specify a ``readConcern`` of ``"majority"`` to
read data that has been written to a majority of nodes and thus cannot
be rolled back.

``readConcern`` Option
----------------------

The ``readConcern`` option takes a document that can specify the
``level`` of ``readConcern``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <majority|local> }

For the ``level`` field, specify either the string ``"majority"`` or
``"local"``.

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - ``level``
     - Description

   * - .. readconcern:: "local"

     - Default. The query will return the node's most recent copy of
       data. Provides no guarantee that the data has been written to a
       majority of the nodes.

   * - .. readconcern:: "majority"

     - The query will return the node's most recent copy of the data
       confirmed as having been written to a majority of the nodes.

.. note::
   The most recent data on a node, regardless of the level, may not
   reflect the most recent version of the data in the system.

Operations That Support ``readConcern``
---------------------------------------

The ``readConcern`` is available for the following operations:

- :dbcommand:`find` command

- :dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method

- :dbcommand:`distinct` command

- :dbcommand:`count` command

- :dbcommand:`parallelCollectionScan` command

- :dbcommand:`geoNear` command

- :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command
