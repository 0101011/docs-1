====================
Meta Query Operators
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Introduction
------------

In addition to the :doc:`MongoDB Query Operators
</reference/operators>`, there are a number of "meta" operators that
you may use to modify the output or behavior of a
query. Specify these modifiers to a :method:`db.collection.find()` query, in the
following form (for the :program:`mongo` shell):

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { [QUERY] } )._addSpecial( [MODIFIER] )

Here, the query specified by ``[QUERY]`` runs on the collection
named ``collection`` with the operation specified by the
``[MODIFIER]``. The results are then processed by a modifier expression
selected from the following list. Many of the operators have
corresponding :doc:`methods in the shell </reference/javascript>`. For
the proposes of this reference, this document assumes the above form
where possible.
