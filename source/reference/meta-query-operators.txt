Meta Query Operators
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Introduction
------------

In addition to the :doc:`MongoDB Query Operators
</reference/operators>`, there are a number of "meta" operators that
you may use to modify the output or behavior of a
query. Specify these modifiers to a :method:`db.collection.find()` query, in the
following forms (for the :program:`mongo` shell):

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <QUERY> } )._addSpecial( <MODIFIER> )
   db.collection.find( { $query: { <QUERY> }, <MODIFIER> } )
 
Here, the query specified by ``<QUERY>`` runs on the collection named
``collection`` with the operation specified by the ``<MODIFIER>``. The
results are then processed by a modifier expression selected from the
following list. MongoDB treats the query and the
modifiers as a single object, with the :operator:`$query` and the meta
operators included in a single document.

Modifiers
---------

Many of the operators have corresponding :doc:`methods
in the shell </reference/javascript>`.
