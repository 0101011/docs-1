description: |
  The amount of time that the :program:`mongod` will wait for another
  secondary in the replica set to catch up to the primary. If no
  secondary catches up before this period ends, then the command will
  fail and the member will not step down, unless you specify ``{
  force: true }``.

  The default value is ``10`` seconds, unless you set ``{ force: true
  }``, which changes the default to ``0``.
