replSetMaintenance
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: replSetMaintenance

   The :dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance` command enables/disables the maintenance
   mode.
   
   The command has the following prototype format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetMaintenance: <boolean> }

   Consider the following behavior when running the
   :dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance` command:
   
   - You cannot run the command on the Primary.
   - You must run the command against the ``admin`` database.
   - When enabled ``replSetMaintenance: 1``, the member will change state to ``RECOVERING``.

   .. admin-only
