.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: geoNear

   The :dbcommand:`geoNear` command provides an alternative to the
   :dbcommand:`$near` operator. In addition to the
   functionality of :operator:`$near`, :dbcommand:`geoNear` returns the distance of
   each item from the specified point along with additional diagnostic
   information. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { geoNear : "places" , near : [50,50], num : 10 }

   Here, :dbcommand:`geoNear` returns the 10 items nearest to the
   coordinates ``[50,50]`` in the collection named
   ``places``. `geoNear` provides the following options (specify all
   distances in the same units as the document coordinate system:)

   :field near: Takes the coordinates (e.g. ``[ x, y ]``) to use as
                the center of a geospatial query.

   :field num: Specifies the maximum number of documents to return.

   :field maxDistance: Limits the results to those falling within
                       a given distance of the center coordinate.

   :field query: Further narrows the results using any standard
                 MongoDB query operator or selection. See :func:`db.collection.find()`
                 and ":doc:`/reference/operators`" for more
                 information.

   :field distanceMultipler: Specifies a factor to multiply
                             all distances returned by
                             :dbcommand:`geoNear`. For example, use
                             ``distanceMultiplier`` to convert from
                             spherical queries returned in radians to
                             linear units (i.e. miles or kilometers)
                             by multiplying by the radius of the
                             Earth.
