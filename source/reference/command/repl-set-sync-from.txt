replSetSyncFrom
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: replSetSyncFrom

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   :option host: Specifies the name and port number of the set member
                 that you want *this* member to sync from. Use
                 the ``[hostname]:[port]`` form.

   :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` allows you to explicitly configure
   which host the current :program:`mongod` will pull data from. This
   operation may be useful for testing different patterns and in
   situations where a set member is not syncing from the host you
   want. You may **not** use this command to force a member to sync
   from:

   - itself.
   - an arbiter.
   - a member that does not build indexes.
   - an unreachable member.
   - a :program:`mongod` instance that is not a member of the same
     replica set.

   If you attempt to sync from a member that is more than 10 seconds
   behind the current member, :program:`mongod` will return and log a
   warning, but *will* sync from such members.

   The command has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetSyncFrom: "[hostname]:[port]" }

   To run the command in the :program:`mongo` shell, use the following
   invocation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { replSetSyncFrom: "[hostname]:[port]" } )

   You may also use the :method:`rs.syncFrom()` helper in the
   :program:`mongo` shell, in an operation with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.syncFrom("[hostname]:[port]")

   .. slave-ok, admin-only
