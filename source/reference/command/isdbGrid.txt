isdbGrid
========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: isdbGrid

   Use this command to determine if the process is a :program:`mongos`
   or a :program:`mongod`. Consider the following command prototype:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { isdbGrid: 1 }

   If connected to a :program:`mongos`, the response document
   resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "isdbgrid" : 1, "hostname" : "app.example.net", "ok" : 1 }

   You can also use the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command, which when
   connected to a :program:`mongos`, contains the string
   ``isdbgrid`` in the ``msg`` field of its output document.
