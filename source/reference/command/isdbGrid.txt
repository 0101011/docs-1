.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: isdbgrid

   This command verifies that a process is a :program:`mongos`.

   If you issue the :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command when connected to a :program:`mongos`, the response document
   resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "isdbgrid" : 1, "hostname" : "app.example.net", "ok" : 1 }

   However, if you issue the :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command when conneted
   to a :program:`mongod`, the returned document also might include a
   line that reads ``"isdbgrid" : 1``, though in this case as part of an
   error message. The :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command is not available to
   :program:`mongod` and returns an error document similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         "errmsg" : "no such cmd: isdbgrid",
         "bad cmd" : {
               "isdbgrid" : 1
         },
         "ok" : 0
      }

   You can instead use the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command to determine
   connection to a :program:`mongos`. When connected to a
   :program:`mongos`, the :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns a document that
   contains the string ``isdbgrid`` in the ``msg`` field.
