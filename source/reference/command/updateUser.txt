Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: updateUser

   Updates the user's profile on the database on which you run the
   command. An update to a field **completely replaces** the previous
   field's values, including updates to the user's ``roles`` array.

   .. warning::

      When you update the ``roles`` array, you completely replace the
      previous array's values. To add roles without replacing the user's
      existing roles, use the :dbcommand:`grantRolesToUser` command.

   The :dbcommand:`updateUser` command uses the following syntax. To
   update a user, you must specify `the `updateUser`` field and at least
   one other field, other than ``writeConcern``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { updateUser: "<username>",
        pwd: "<cleartext password>",
        customData: { <any information> },
        roles: [
          { role: "<role>", db: "<database>" } | "<role>",
          ...
        ],
        writeConcern: { <write concern> }
      }

   The command has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/updateUser-field.rst

   .. |local-cmd-name| replace:: :dbcommand:`updateUser`
   .. include:: /includes/fact-roles-array-contents.rst

Required Access
---------------

To update the ``roles`` array, a user must have a privileges that
include the :authaction:`revokeAnyRole` action on all databases. To add roles in
an update, a user must have privileges that include the
:authaction:`grantAnyRole` action on the database where the role exists.

To modify the ``pwd`` or ``customData`` fields of a users own
credentials users own account, that user must have
privileges that include the :authaction:`changeOwnPassword` action or
:authaction:`changeOwnCustomData` on the on the ``cluster`` resource.

To change another user's ``pwd`` or ``customData`` field, a user must
have privileges that include the :authaction:`changeAnyPassword`
action or :authaction:`changeAnyCustomData` action on that user's
database.

Example
-------

Given a user with the following user info:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : "products.Erin",
      "user" : "Erin",
      "db" : "products",
      "customData" : { "empID" : "12345", "badge" : "9156" },
      "roles" : [
          { "role" : "readWrite",
            "db" : "products"
          },
          { "role" : "read",
            "db" : "inventory"
          }
      ]
   }

The following :dbcommand:`updateUser` command **completely** replaces the
user's ``customData`` and ``roles`` data:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { updateUser : "Erin",
                    customData : { employeeId : "0x3039" },
                    roles : [
                      { role : "assetsReader",
                        db : "assets"  
                } ] } )

The command results in the following user document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : "products.Erin",
      "user" : "Erin",
      "db" : "products",
      "customData" : { "employeeId" : "0x3039" },
      "roles" : [
          { "role" : "assetsReader",
            "db" : "assets"
          }
      ]
   }
