.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: shardingState

   The :dbcommand:`shardingState` command returns ``true`` if the
   :program:`mongod` instance is a member of a sharded cluster. Run the
   command using the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shardingState: 1 }

   .. warning::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed; however, the
      operation is typically short lived.
