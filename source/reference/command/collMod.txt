.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: collMod

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   :dbcommand:`collMod` makes it possible to add flags to a collection
   to modify the behavior of MongoDB. In the current release the only
   available flag is :collflag:`usePowerof2Sizes`. The command takes the
   following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( {"collMod" : [collection] , "[flag]" : [value]" } )

   In this command substitute ``[collection]`` with the name of the
   collection, and ``[flag]`` and ``[value]`` with the flag and value
   you want to set.

   .. index:: document; space allocation
   .. index:: usePowerOf2Sizes
   .. _usePowerOf2Sizes:
   .. collflag:: usePowerOf2Sizes

      The :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` flag changes the method that
      MongoDB uses to allocate space on disk for documents in this
      collection. By setting :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`, you ensure
      that MongoDB will allocate space for documents in sizes that
      are powers of 2 (e.g. 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512...8388608).
      With this option MongoDB will be able to more effectively reuse
      space.

      :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` is useful for collections where you
      will be inserting and deleting large numbers of documents to
      ensure that MongoDB will effectively use space on disk.

      .. note::
         .. versionchanged:: 2.2.1
            If you're using :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`, ensure
            you use at least 2.2.1 to avoid the issue described in
            :issue:`SERVER-7238`.

         :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` only affects subsequent
         allocations cased by document insertion or record relocation
         as a result of document growth, and *does not* affect
         existing allocations.

         This command obtains a write lock on the affected database
         and will block other operations until it has completed.
