.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: drop

   The :dbcommand:`drop` command removes an entire collection from a
   database. The command has following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { drop: <collection_name> }

   The :program:`mongo` shell provides the equivalent helper
   method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.drop();

   Note that this command also removes any indexes associated with the
   dropped collection.

   .. warning::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed.
