.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: buildInfo

   The :dbcommand:`buildInfo` command is an administrative command which
   returns a build summary for the current :program:`mongod`.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { buildInfo: 1 }

   The information provided includes the following:

   - The version of MongoDB currently running.

   - The information about the system that built the
     ":program:`mongod`" binary, including a timestamp for the build.

   - The architecture of the binary (i.e. 64 or 32 bits.)

   - The maximum allowable :term:`BSON` object size in bytes (in the field ``maxBsonObjectSize``.)

     
   .. TODO 2.4
      
      - The compiler flags used to build the :program:`mongod`.

      - The JavaScript Engine used. By default before 2.4 this is
        "spidermonkey," after 2.4 this is "V8."
