.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

.. dbcommand:: replSetStepDown

   Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a
   :term:`secondary`. This initiates an :ref:`election for primary
   <replica-set-election-internals>`.

   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: <seconds> , force: <true|false> } )

   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/replSetStepDown-field.rst

Behavior
--------

Client Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` forces all clients
currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps
ensure that clients maintain an accurate view of the replica
set.

Secondary Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.8
   To avoid rollbacks, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` will wait for one
   secondary to be totally caught up before allowing the primary to
   step down.

Example
-------

The following example specifies that the former primary avoids
reelection to primary for 120 seconds:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120 } )

.. slave-ok, admin-only
