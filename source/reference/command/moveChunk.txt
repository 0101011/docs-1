.. dbcommand:: moveChunk

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` is an internal command that supports the
   sharding. Use the :method:`sh.moveChunk()` helper in the
   :program:`mongo` shell for manual chunk migrations.

   :option _secondaryThrottle: Set to ``false`` by default. Provides
                               :ref:`write concern <write-concern>`
                               support for chunk migrations.

   If ``_secondaryThrottle`` is set to ``true``, during chunk
   migrations when a :term:`shard` hosted by a :term:`replica set`,
   the :program:`mongod` will wait until the :term:`secondary` members
   replicate the migration operations continuing to migrate chunk
   data. In the balancer configuration, the ``replThrottle``
   configuration provides ``_secondaryThrottle`` behavior.

   For details on chunk migrations see the :ref:`Chunk Migration
   <sharding-chunk-migration>` section.
