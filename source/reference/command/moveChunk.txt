.. dbcommand:: moveChunk

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` is an internal command that supports the
   sharding functionality. Use the
   :method:`sh.moveChunk()` function in the :program:`mongo` shell if
   you must move a chunk manually.

   :option _secondaryThrottle: Optional. The default setting is
                               ``false``. If ``true`` this will
                               specify that primary shard members
                               should wait for its secondary shard
                               members to replicate chunk data updates
                               before allowing new chunk migrations to
                               occur.
