.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` is an :term:`admin database` command that allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs. Use the following syntax: ::

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :program:`mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the :program:`mongod` process.
   If your :program:`mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200


   :dbcommand:`logRotate` will cause the existing log file to be renamed
   by appending the current timestamp to the filename.  A new log file will be created
   with the name which was specified by the :option:`--logpath` option to :program:`mongod` 
   or :program:`mongos`.
   The rotated files will have a timestamp of the form yyyy-mm-ddThh-mm-ss 
   appended to the filename.


   .. note::

      .. versionadded::2.0.3
      
      The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is available to mongod instances
      running on Windows systems with MongoDB release 2.0.3 and higher.
