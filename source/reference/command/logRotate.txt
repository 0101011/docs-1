.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` is an :term:`admin database` command that allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs. Use the following syntax: ::

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :program:`mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the :program:`mongod` process.
   If your :program:`mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200

   The rotated files will have a timestamp of the form ``YYYY-MM-DD``\T ``HH-MM-SS`` 
   appended to the filename.


   .. note::

      .. versionadded::2.0.3
      
      The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is available to mongod instances
      running on Windows systems with MongoDB release 2.0.3 and higher.
