.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: addShard

   :option name: Optional. Unless specified, a name will be
                 automatically provided to uniquely identify
                 the shard.

   :option maxSize: Optional. Unless specified, shards will consume
                    the total amount of available space on their
                    machines if necessary. Use the ``maxSize`` value
                    to limit the amount of space the database can
                    use. Specify this value in megabytes.

   The :dbcommand:`addShard` command registers a new with a sharded
   cluster. You must run this command against a :program:`mongos`
   instance. The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { addShard: "<hostname>:<port>" }

   Replace ``<hostname>:<port>`` with the hostname and port of the
   database instance you want to add as a shard. Because the
   :program:`mongos` instances do not have state and distribute
   configuration in the :term:`config database`, send this
   command to only one :program:`mongos` instance.

   .. note::

      Specify a ``maxSize`` when you have machines with different disk
      capacities, or if you want to limit the amount of data on some
      shards.

      The ``maxSize`` constraint prevents the :term:`balancer` from
      migrating chunks to the shard when the value of
      :status:`mem.mapped` exceeds the value of ``maxSize``.
