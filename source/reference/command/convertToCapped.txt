.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: convertToCapped

   The :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command converts an existing,
   non-capped collection to a :term:`capped collection`. Use the
   following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {convertToCapped: "collection", size: 100 * 1024 }

   This command coverts ``collection``, an existing collection, to a
   capped collection, with a maximum size of 100 KB. This command
   accepts the ``size`` and ``max`` options. See the
   :dbcommand:`create` command for additional details.

   .. warning::

      The :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` will not recreate indexes from
      the original collection on the new collection. If you need
      indexes on this collection you will need to create these indexes
      after the conversion is complete.
