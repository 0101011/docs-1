Collection Validation Statistics
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

The collection validation command checks all of the structures within
a name space for correctness and returns a :term:`document` containing
information regarding the on-disk representation of the collection

.. warning::

   Because :dbcommand:`validate` must scan all data in the collection,
   this command may consume a significant amount of systems resources
   and impede the performance of your database while the operation
   progresses.

Run the validation command in the :program:`mongo` shell using the
following form to validate a collection named ``people``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.validate()

Alternatively you can use the command prototype and the
:func:`db.runCommand()` shell helper in the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { validate: "people", full: true } )
   db.people.validate(true)

.. seealso:: ":dbcommand:`validate`" and ":func:`validate()`."

Values
------

.. data:: ns

   The full namespace name of the collection. Namespaces include the
   database name and the collection name in the form
   ``database.collection``.

.. data:: firstExtent

   The disk location of the first extent in the collection. The value
   of this field also includes the namespace.

.. data:: lastExtent

   The disk location of the last extent in the collection. The value
   of this field also includes the namespace.

.. data:: extentCount

   The number of extents in the collection.

.. data:: extents

   :dbcommand:`validate` returns one instance of this document for
   every extent in the collection. This sub-document is only returned
   when you specify the ``full`` option to the command.

   .. data:: extents.loc

      The disk location for the beginning of this extent.

   .. data:: extents.xnext

      The disk location for the extent following this one. "null" if
      this is the end of the linked list of extents.

   .. data:: extents.xprev

      The disk location for the extent preceding this one. "null" if
      this is the head of the linked list of extents.

   .. data:: extents.nsdiag

      The namespace this extent belongs to (should be the same as the
      namespace shown at the beginning of the validate listing).

   .. data:: extents.size

      The number of bytes in this extent.

   .. data:: extents.firstRecord

      The disk locations of the first record in this extent.

   .. data:: extents.lastRecord

      The disk locations of the last record in this extent.

.. data:: datasize

   The number of bytes in all data records.  This value does not
   include deleted records, nor does it include extent headers, nor
   record headers, nor space in a file unallocated to any
   extent. :data:`datasize` includes record :term:`padding`.

.. data:: nrecords

   The number of :term:`documents <document>` in the collection.

.. data:: lastExtentSize

   The size of the last new extent created in this collection. This
   value determines the size of the *next* extent created.

.. data:: padding

   A floating point value between 1 and 2.

   When MongoDB creates a new record it uses the :term:`padding
   factor` to determine how much additional space to add to the
   record. The Padding factor is automatically adjusted by mongo when
   it notices that update operations are triggering record moves.

.. data:: firstExtentDetails

   The size of the first extent created in this collection. This data
   is similar to the data provided by the :data:`extents`
   sub-document; however, the data reflects only the first extent in
   the collection and is always returned.

   .. data:: firstExtentDetails.loc

      The disk location for the beginning of this extent.

   .. data:: firstExtentDetails.xnext

      The disk location for the extent following this one. "null" if
      this is the end of the linked list of extents, which should only
      be the case if there is only one extent.

   .. data:: firstExtentDetails.xprev

      The disk location for the extent preceding this one. This should
      always be "null."

   .. data:: firstExtentDetails.nsdiag

      The namespace this extent belongs to (should be the same as the
      namespace shown at the beginning of the validate listing).

   .. data:: firstExtentDetails.size

      The number of bytes in this extent.

   .. data:: firstExtentDetails.firstRecord

      The disk locations of the first record in this extent.

   .. data:: firstExtentDetails.lastRecord

      The disk locations of the last record in this extent.

.. data:: objectsFound

   The number of records actually encountered in a scan of the
   collection. This field should have the same value as the
   :data:`nrecords` field.

.. data:: invalidObjects

   The number of records containing BSON documents that do not pass a
   validation check.

   .. note::

      This field is only included in the validation output when you
      specify the ``full`` option.

.. data:: bytesWithHeaders

   This is similar to datasize, except that :data:`bytesWithHeaders`
   includes the record headers. In version 2.0, record headers are 16
   bytes per document.

   .. note::

      This field is only included in the validation output when you
      specify the ``full`` option.

.. data:: bytesWithoutHeaders

   :data:`bytesWithoutHeaders` returns data collected from a scan of
   all records. The value should be the same as :data:`datasize`.

   .. note::

      This field is only included in the validation output when you
      specify the ``full`` option.

.. data:: deletedCount

   The number of deleted or "free" records in the collection.

.. data:: deletedSize

   The size of all deleted or "free" records in the collection.

.. data:: nIndexes

   The number of indexes on the data in the collection.

.. data:: keysPerIndex

   A document containing a field for each index, named after the
   index's name, that contains the number of keys, or documents
   referenced, included in the index.

.. data:: valid

   Boolean. ``true``, unless :dbcommand:`validate` determines that an
   aspect of the collection is not valid. When ``false``, see the
   :data:`errors` field for more information.

.. data:: errors

   Typically empty; however, if the collection is not valid (i.e
   :data:`valid` is false,) this field will contain a message
   describing the validation error.

.. data:: ok

   Set to ``1`` when the command succeeds. If the command fails this
   the :data:`ok` field has a value of ``0``.
