  If the collection is empty, in which case MongoDB creates the index
  prior to sharding the collection. New in version 2.4: The key may be
  in the form ``{ field : "hashed" }``, which will use the specified
  field as a hashed shard key.

  To support :ref:`hashed sharding <sharding-hashed-sharding>` added
  in MongoDB 2.4, ``numInitialChunks`` specifies the number of chunks
  to create when sharding an collection with a hashed shard
  key. MongoDB will then create and balance chunks across the cluster.
  The ``numInitialChunks`` must be less than ``8192`` per shard.
