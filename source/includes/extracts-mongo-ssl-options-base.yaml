     When running {{program}} with the ``--ssl`` option, you must
     include either ``--sslCAFile`` or
     ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates``.

   .. warning::

      For SSL connections (``--ssl``) to :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
      :binary:`~bin.mongos`, if the {{program}} runs without the
      ``--sslCAFile <CAFile>`` option (i.e. specifies the
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` instead), the {{program}} will
      not attempt to validate the server certificates. This creates a
      vulnerability to expired :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
      certificates as well as to foreign processes posing as valid
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. Ensure that you
      *always* specify the CA file to validate the server certificates
      in cases where intrusion is a possibility.
