title: Identify the user's roles.
ref: collect-roles
pre: |
  Use the :dbcommand:`usersInfo` command or :method:`db.getUser()` method to
  display user information.
action:
  - pre: |      
      For example, to view roles for ``reportsUser`` created in
      :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-to-database`, issue:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      use reporting
      db.getUser("reportsUser")
  - pre: |
      In the returned document, the :data:`~admin.system.users.roles`
      field displays all roles for ``reportsUser``:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       ...
       "roles" : [
          { "role" : "readWrite", "db" : "accounts" },
          { "role" : "read", "db" : "reporting" },

          { "role" : "read", "db" : "sales" }
       ]

title: Identify the privileges granted by the roles.
ref: identify-privileges
pre: |
  For a given role, use the :method:`db.getRole()` method, or the
  :dbcommand:`rolesInfo` command, with the ``showPrivileges`` option:
action:
  - pre: |
      For example, to view the privileges granted by ``read`` role on
      the ``products`` database, use the following operation, issue:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      use products
      db.getRole( "read", { showPrivileges: true } )
  - pre: |
      In the returned document, the :data:`~rolesInfo.privileges` and
      :data:`~rolesInfo.inheritedPrivileges` arrays. The
      :data:`~rolesInfo.privileges` lists the privileges directly
      specified by the role and excludes those privileges inherited
      from other roles. The :data:`~rolesInfo.inheritedPrivileges`
      lists all privileges granted by this role, both directly
      specified and inherited. If the role does not inherit from other
      roles, the two fields are the same.
