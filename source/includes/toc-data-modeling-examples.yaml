description: |
   Presents a data model that uses :ref:`embedded documents
   <data-modeling-embedding>` to describe one-to-one relationships
   between connected data.

file: /tutorial/model-embedded-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents
description: |
   Presents a data model that uses :ref:`embedded documents
   <data-modeling-embedding>` to describe one-to-many relationships
   between connected data.
---
file: /tutorial/model-referenced-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents
description: |
   Presents a data model that uses :ref:`references
   <data-modeling-references>` to describe one-to-many relationships
   between documents.

file: /tutorial/model-data-for-atomic-operations
description: |
   Illustrates how embedding fields related to an atomic update within
   the same document ensures that the fields are in sync

file: /tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-parent-references
description: |
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-references>` to
   "parent" nodes in "child" nodes.
---
file: /tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-child-references
description: |
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-references>` to
   "child" nodes in "parent" nodes.
---
file: /tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-ancestors-array
description: |
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-references>` to
   "parent" nodes and an array that stores all ancestors.
---
file: /tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-materialized-paths
description: |
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure by storing full relationship paths between documents. In
   addition to the tree node, each document stores the ``_id``(s)
   of the nodes ancestors or path as a string.

file: /tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-nested-sets
description: |
   Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
   structure using the *Nested Sets* pattern. This optimizes
   discovering subtrees at the expense of tree mutability.
