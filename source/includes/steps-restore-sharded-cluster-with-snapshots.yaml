title: Shut down the entire cluster.
stepnum: 1
ref: shutdown-cluster
pre: |
  Stop all :binary:`~bin.mongos` and :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes, including
  all shards *and* all config servers.
action:
  pre: |
    Connect to each member use the following operation:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()
  post: |
    For version 2.4 or earlier, use ``db.shutdownServer({force:true})``.

title: Restore the data files.
stepnum: 2
ref: restore
pre: |
  One each server, extract the data files to the location where the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance will access them. Restore the following:
action:
  - heading: "Data files for each server in each shard."
    pre: |
      Because replica sets provide each production :term:`shard`, restore
      all the members of the replica set or use the other standard
      approaches for restoring a replica set from backup. See the
      :ref:`backup-restore-snapshot` and :ref:`backup-restore-dump`
      sections for details on these procedures.
  - heading: "Data files for each config server."

title: Restart the config servers.
stepnum: 3
ref: restart-config-servers
pre: |
  Restart each :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance by issuing a command similar to the
  following for each, using values appropriate to your configuration:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --configsvr --dbpath /data/configdb --port 27019

title: "If shard hostnames have changed, update the config string and config database."
stepnum: 4
ref: shard-hostname
content: |
  If shard hostnames **have changed**, start **one** :binary:`~bin.mongos`
  instance using the updated config string with the new ``configdb``
  hostnames and ports.

  Then update the ``shards`` collection in the :ref:`config-database` to
  reflect the new hostnames. Then stop the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

title: "Restart all the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances."
stepnum: 6
ref: restart-mongos-instances

  If shard hostnames **have changed**, make sure to use the updated config
  string.

title: "Connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` to ensure the cluster is operational."
stepnum: 7
ref: ensure
pre: |
  Connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance from a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
  and use the :method:`db.printShardingStatus()` method to ensure that
  the cluster is operational, as follows:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    db.printShardingStatus()
    show collections
