  Enables a :term:`capped collection`. To create a capped collection,
  specify ``true``. If you specify ``true``, you must also set a maximum
  size in the ``size`` field.

  If ``capped`` is ``true``, specify ``false`` to disable the automatic
  creation of an index on the ``_id`` field. Before 2.2, the default
  value for ``autoIndexId`` was ``false``. See
  :ref:`2.2-id-indexes-capped-collections` for more information.

arg_name: field

  Specifies a maximum size in bytes for a capped collection. The
  ``size`` field is required for capped collections. If ``capped`` is
  false, you can use this field to preallocate space for an ordinary
  collection.

name: size
operation: db.createCollection
optional: true

arg_name: field
description: |
  The maximum number of documents allowed in the capped collection. The
  ``size`` limit takes precedence over this limit. If a capped
  collection reaches its maximum ``size`` before it reaches the maximum
  number of documents, MongoDB removes old documents. If you prefer to
  use this limit, ensure that the ``size`` limit, which is required, is
  sufficient to contain the documents limit.
