  Enables a :term:`capped collection`. To create a capped collection,
  specify ``true``. If you specify ``true``, you must also set a maximum
  size in the ``size`` field.

  Specify ``false`` to disable the automatic creation of an index on the
  ``_id`` field. Before 2.2, the default value for ``autoIndexId`` was
  ``false``. See :ref:`2.2-id-indexes-capped-collections` for more
  information.

  Do **not** set ``autoIndexId`` to ``true`` for replicated
  collections.

  Specifies a maximum size in bytes for a capped collection. The
  ``size`` field is required for capped collections, and ignored for
  other collections.

operation: db.createCollection
optional: true
position: 3

arg_name: field

  The maximum number of documents allowed in the capped collection. The
  ``size`` limit takes precedence over this limit. If a capped
  collection reaches its maximum ``size`` before it reaches the maximum
  number of documents, MongoDB removes old documents. If you prefer to
  use this limit, ensure that the ``size`` limit, which is required, is
  sufficient to contain the documents limit.

  .. deprecated:: 3.0
     For ``mmapv1``, all collections have
     :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` allocation unless the ``noPadding``
     option is ``true``.
interface: method
name: usePowerOf2Sizes
operation: db.createCollection
optional: true
position: 5

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0
     For ``mmapv1``, ``noPadding`` flag removes all additional space in the record
     allocation, so that the allocation does not permit documents to grow
     after insertion without a new allocation. Defaults to
     ``false``. Use for insert-only workloads.
interface: method
name: noPadding
operation: db.createCollection
optional: true

  .. versionadded:: 3.0

  Allows users to specify configuration to the storage engine on a
  per-collection basis when creating a collection. The value of the
  ``storageEngine`` option should take the following form:e

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { <storage-engine-name>: <options> }

  Storage engine configuration specified when creating collections are
  validated and logged to the :term:`oplog` during replication to
  support replica sets with members that use different storage
  engines.
interface: method
name: storageEngine
operation: db.createCollection
optional: true
