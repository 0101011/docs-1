.. note::

   If you're not logged in and using authentication, |operation-name|
   has no effect.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      Because a user account in MongoDB may be delegated from one
      database to another, you must call |operation-name| while
      using the same database context that you authenticated to.
