description: |
    Remove the data on a "stale" :term:`secondary` and perform an
    initial sync to update the secondary with the :term:`replica set's
    <replica set>` current data.

file: /tutorial/change-oplog-size
description: |
    Increase the size of the :term:`oplog`, which is an internal
    :term:`capped collection` used in replication. In most cases, the
    default oplog size is sufficient.

file: /tutorial/force-member-to-be-primary
description: |
    Force a replica set member to become :term:`primary` by giving it a
    higher :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value than
    other members.

file: /tutorial/reconfigure-replica-set-with-unavailable-members
description: |
    Reconfigure a replica set when a majority of replica set members
    are down or unreachable.
---
file: /tutorial/manage-chained-replication
description: |
    Disable or enable chained replication. Chained replication occurs
    when a secondary replicates from another secondary instead of the
    primary.
---
file: /tutorial/change-hostnames-in-a-replica-set
description: |
    Change each member's hostname in the replica set's internal
    :data:`local.system.replset` collection. Use this procedure when
    the hostnames for the :program:`mongod` instances have changed'.
---
file: /tutorial/configure-replica-set-secondary-sync-target
description: |
    Change which replica set member a secondary member synchronizes from.
---
file: /tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets
description: |
    Assign tags to replica set members for use in targetting read and
    write operations to specific members.
