  The collection to query.

arg_name: field

  The point for which to find the closest documents.
interface: command
name: near
operation: geoNear
optional: false
position: 2
type:
- GeoJSON point
- :term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate pairs>`

arg_name: field
description: |
  The maximum number of documents to return. The default value is ``100``.
  See also the ``num`` option.
interface: command
name: limit
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 3
type: number
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  The ``num`` option provides the same function as the ``limit`` option.
  Both define the maximum number of documents to return. If both options
  are included, the ``num`` value overrides the ``limit`` value.
interface: command
name: num
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 4
type: number
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  A distance from the center point. Specify the distance in meters for
  :term:`GeoJSON` data and
  in radians for :term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate
  pairs>`. MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall
  within the specified distance from the center point.
interface: command
name: maxDistance
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 5
type: number
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  Limits the results to the documents that match the query. The query
  syntax is the usual MongoDB :ref:`read operation query
  <read-operations-query-argument>` syntax.
interface: command
name: query
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 6
type: document
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  Required *if* using a :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>` index. For use
  with ``2dsphere`` indexes, ``spherical`` must be ``true``.

  The default value is ``false``.
interface: command
name: spherical
operation: geoNear
optional: false
position: 7
type: Boolean
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  The factor to multiply all distances returned by the query. For
  example, use the ``distanceMultiplier`` to convert radians, as
  returned by a spherical query, to kilometers by multiplying by the
  radius of the Earth.
interface: command
name: distanceMultiplier
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 8
type: number
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  If this is ``true``, the query
  returns the location of the matching documents in the results. The
  default is ``false``. This option is useful when a location field
  contains multiple locations. To specify a field within a
  subdocument, use :term:`dot notation`.
interface: command
name: includeLocs
operation: geoNear
optional: true
position: 9
type: Boolean
---
arg_name: field
description: |
  If this value is ``true``, the query returns a matching document once,
  even if more than one of the document's location fields match the
  query. If this value is ``false``, the query returns a document
  multiple times if the document has multiple matching location fields.
  See :query:`$uniqueDocs` for more information.
interface: command
name: uniqueDocs
operation: geoNear
optional: true
