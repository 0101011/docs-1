file: /tutorial/create-a-unique-index
description: |
   Create an index with a :ref:`unique constraint` that will prevent
   applications from inserting documents that have duplicate values for
   the inserted fields. Force unique index creation using the
   ``dropDups`` option that will delete documents with duplicate values
   when building the index.
---
file: /tutorial/create-a-sparse-index
description: |
   Create an index that omits references to documents that do not

file: /tutorial/query-a-2d-index
description: |
   Query a 2d index with points within a shape defined on a flat surface,
   points within a circle on a sphere, by proximity to a point
   on a flat surface, or targeting an exact match on a flat surface.
---
file: /tutorial/build-a-2dsphere-index
description: |
   Create a ``2dsphere`` index for GeoJSON-formatted data.
---
file: /tutorial/query-a-2dsphere-index
description: |
   Query for location data found within a GeoJSON polygon, for 
   locations that intersect a specified GeoJSON object, by proximity
   to a GeoJSON point, or targeting points within a circle defined
   on a sphere.
---
file: /tutorial/build-a-geohaystack-index
description: |
   Create a haystack index.
---
file: /tutorial/query-a-geohaystack-index
description: |
   Query a haystack index using the ``geoSearch`` command.

file: /tutorial/calculate-distances-using-spherical-geometry-with-2d-geospatial-indexes
description: |
   Calculate distances on a Euclidean plane using ``2d`` indexes.
---
file: /tutorial/enable-text-search
description: |
   Enable the text search feature when starting your :program:`mongod`
   instance or in your :def:`configuration file
   <reference/configuration-options>`. You must explicitly enable text
   search before you can create a text index or use the
   :dbcommand:`text` command.

file: /tutorial/create-text-index-on-multiple-fields
description: |
   Create a text index on multiple fields.
---
file: /tutorial/specify-language-for-text-index

   Specify the language for indexed data. The specified language
   determines the list of stop words and the rules for Text Search's
   stemmer and tokenizer.

   Create a text index on a multi-language collection
---
file: /tutorial/control-results-of-text-search
description: |
   Set the weight of an indexed field to denote its significance
   relative to other indexed fields, determining which documents
   the :dbcommand:`text` returns.
---
file: /tutorial/limit-number-of-items-scanned-for-text-search
