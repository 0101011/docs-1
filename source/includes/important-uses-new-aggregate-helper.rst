   The examples in this section use the
   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper provided in the 2.5.3
   version of the :program:`mongo` shell against the 2.5.3 version of
   the MongoDB server. To run the examples, you must update *both* the
   :program:`mongo` shell and the MongoDB servers.
