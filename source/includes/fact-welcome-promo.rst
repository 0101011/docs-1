   :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` is a fast and easy way to get started with 
   MongoDB. |atlas-full|, our fully-managed database-as-a-service, 
   enables you to configure anything from a free sandbox environment to 
   a globally sharded production cluster.

   To get started, use the promotional code ``REALMONGO`` to spin up 
   an |atlas| cluster.
