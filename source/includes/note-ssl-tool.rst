.. versionadded:: 2.4
   MongoDB added support for TLS/SSL connections to :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances in |tool-binary|.

.. note::

   TLS/SSL support in |tool-binary| is not compiled into the default
   distribution of MongoDB. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information on TLS/SSL
   and MongoDB.

   Additionally, |tool-binary| does not support connections to
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances that require client certificate
   validation.
