Documents have a 16 megabytes size limit.

The maximum document size helps ensure that a single document cannot
use neither an excessive amount of RAM nor excessive amount of
bandwidth to transmit. To store larger objects, MongoDB provides the
GridFS API to handle documents larger than the maximum size. See your
specific driver documentation for GridFS.
