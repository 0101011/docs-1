Before switching any member to the WiredTiger storage engine, you must
update all members of the replica set/sharded cluster to the MongoDB
3.0 binaries. You cannot use the WiredTiger storage engine with a mixed
version replica set/sharded cluster that contains both version 2.6 and
version 3.0 binaries.
