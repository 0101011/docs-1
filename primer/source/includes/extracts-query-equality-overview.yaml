   If the ``<field>`` is a top-level field and not a field in an embedded
   document or an array, you can either enclose the field name in quotes
   or omit the quotes.

   If the ``<field>`` is in an embedded document or an array, use
   :term:`dot notation` to access the field. With dot notation, you must
   enclose the dotted name in quotes.
