Remove Data

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB provides the :method:`~db.collection.remove()` method to remove
documents from a collection.

You must specify a remove condition. To specify the remove condition,
use the same structure and syntax as the query conditions. See
:doc:`/query` for an introduction to query conditions.

Consideration
-------------

In MongoDB, write operations are atomic on the level of a single
document. If a single remove operation removes multiple documents from
a collection, the operation can interleave with other write operations
on that collection.

Prerequisite
------------

The examples in this section query the ``inventory`` collection in the
``test`` database. To populate the collection, see
:doc:`/tutorial/prerequisite`.
