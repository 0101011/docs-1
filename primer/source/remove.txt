Additional Information
----------------------

In MongoDB, write operations are atomic on the level of a single
document. If a single remove operation removes multiple documents from
a collection, the operation can interleave with other write operations
on that collection. See :method:`~db.collection.remove()` for more
information regarding the method behavior.
