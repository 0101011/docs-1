Additional Information
----------------------

MongoDB provides several different index types to support different
kinds of queries and data sets. See the :manual:`Index Introduction
</core/indexes-introduction>` in the Mongodb Manual for the different
index types supported in MongoDB.

You can also specify various properties for indexes, such as a *unique
constraint*. For the options available, refer to your driver's API.
