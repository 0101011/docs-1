"A hidden member maintains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data set"
" but is **invisible** to client applications. Hidden members are good for "
"workloads with different usage patterns from the other members in the "
":term:`replica set`. Hidden members must always be :ref:`priority 0 members "
"<replica-set-secondary-only-members>` and so **cannot become primary**. The "
":method:`db.isMaster()` method does not display hidden members. Hidden "
"members, however, **may vote** in :ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`."
