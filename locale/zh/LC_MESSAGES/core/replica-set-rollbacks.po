"A rollback reverts write operations on a former :term:`primary` when the "
"member rejoins its :term:`replica set` after a :term:`failover`. A rollback "
"is necessary only if the primary had accepted write operations that the "
":term:`secondaries <secondary>` had **not** successfully replicated before "
"the primary stepped down. When the primary rejoins the set as a secondary, "
"it reverts, or \"rolls back,\" its write operations to maintain database "

"MongoDB attempts to avoid rollbacks, which should be rare. When a rollback "
