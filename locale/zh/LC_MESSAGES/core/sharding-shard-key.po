"MongoDB generates ``ObjectId`` values upon document creation to produce a "

"regular and predictable pattern. Even though this value has :ref:`high "
"cardinality <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>`, when using this, *any date, "
"or other monotonically increasing number* as the shard key, all insert "
"operations will be storing data into a single chunk, and therefore, a single"
" shard. As a result, the write capacity of this shard will define the "
"effective write capacity of the cluster."

"A shard key that increases monotonically will not hinder performance if you "

"Typically, a computed shard key that has some amount of \"randomness,\" such"
