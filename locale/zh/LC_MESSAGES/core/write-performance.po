"After every insert, update, or delete operation, MongoDB must update *every*"
" index associated with the collection in addition to the data itself. "
"Therefore, every index on a collection adds some amount of overhead for the "
"performance of write operations. [#exceptions]_"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/write-performance.txt:15
msgid ""
"In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read operations*"
" are worth the insertion penalty. However, in order to optimize write "
"performance when possible, be careful when creating new indexes and evaluate"
" the existing indexes to ensure that your queries actually use these "
"indexes."

"For inserts and updates to un-indexed fields, the overhead for :ref:`sparse "
"indexes <index-type-sparse>` is less than for non-sparse indexes. Also for "
"non-sparse indexes, updates that do not change the record size have less "
"indexing overhead."

"Some update operations can increase the size of the document; for instance, "
"if an update adds a new field to the document."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/write-performance.txt:38
msgid ""
"For the MMAPv1 storage engine, if an update operation causes a document to "
"exceed the currently allocated :term:`record size`, MongoDB relocates the "
"document on disk with enough contiguous space to hold the document. Updates "
"that require relocations take longer than updates that do not, particularly "
"if the collection has indexes. If a collection has indexes, MongoDB must "
"update all index entries. Thus, for a collection with many indexes, the move"
" will impact the write throughput."

#: ../source/core/write-performance.txt:49
msgid ""
"By default, MongoDB uses :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` to add :ref:`padding "
"automatically <record-allocation-strategies>` for the MMAPv1 storage engine."
" The :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` ensures that MongoDB allocates document "
"space in sizes that are powers of 2, which helps ensure that MongoDB can "
"efficiently reuse free space created by document deletion or relocation as "
"well as reduce the occurrences of reallocations in many cases."

"Although :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` minimizes the occurrence of re-"
"allocation, it does not eliminate document re-allocation."

"The capability of the storage system creates some important physical limits "

"MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal` to "
"guarantee :doc:`write operation </core/write-operations>` durability and to "
"provide crash resiliency. Before applying a change to the data files, "
"MongoDB writes the change operation to the journal."

"While the durability assurance provided by the journal typically outweigh "

"following interactions between the journal and performance:"

#: ../source/core/write-performance.txt:94
msgid ""
"if the journal and the data file reside on the same block device, the data "
"files and the journal may have to contend for a finite number of available "
"write operations. Moving the journal to a separate device may increase the "
"capacity for write operations."

"if applications specify :doc:`write concern </core/write-concern>` that "

"can increases the overall write load."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/write-performance.txt:104
msgid ""
"the duration between journal commits is configurable using the "
":setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` run-time option. Decreasing the"
" period between journal commits will increase the number of write "
"operations, which can limit MongoDB's capacity for write operations. "
"Increasing the amount of time between commits may decrease the total number "
"of write operation, but also increases the chance that the journal will not "
"record a write operation in the event of a failure."
