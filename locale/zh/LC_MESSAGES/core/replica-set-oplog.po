"The :term:`oplog` (operations log) is a special :term:`capped collection` "
"that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify the data stored in"
" your databases. MongoDB applies database operations on the :term:`primary` "
"and then records the operations on the primary's oplog. The "
":term:`secondary` members then copy and apply these operations in an "
"asynchronous process. All replica set members contain a copy of the oplog, "
"in the :data:`local.oplog.rs` collection, which allows them to maintain the "
"current state of the database."

"In most cases, the default oplog size is sufficient. For example, if an "
"oplog is 5% of free disk space and fills up in 24 hours of operations, then "
"secondaries can stop copying entries from the oplog for up to 24 hours "
"without becoming too stale to continue replicating. However, most replica "

"higher numbers of operations."
