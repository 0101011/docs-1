"When operating on a sharded collection, the aggregation pipeline is split "
"into two parts. The first pipeline runs on each shard, or if an early "
":pipeline:`$match` can exclude shards through the use of the shard key in "
"the predicate, the pipeline runs on only the relevant shards."

"The second pipeline consists of the remaining pipeline stages and runs on "
"the :ref:`primary shard <primary-shard>`. The primary shard merges the "
"cursors from the other shards and runs the second pipeline on these results."
" The primary shard forwards the final results to the :program:`mongos`. In "
"previous versions, the second pipeline would run on the :program:`mongos`. "
