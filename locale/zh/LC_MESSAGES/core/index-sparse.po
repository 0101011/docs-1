"Sparse indexes only contain entries for documents that have the indexed "
"field, even if the index field contains a null value. The index skips over "
"any document that is missing the indexed field. The index is \"sparse\" "

"sparse indexes contain all documents in a collection, storing null values "
"for those documents that do not contain the indexed field."
