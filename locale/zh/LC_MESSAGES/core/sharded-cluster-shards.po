"A shard is a :term:`replica set` or a single :program:`mongod` that contains"

"MongoDB shards data on a *per collection* basis. You *must* access all data "
"in a sharded cluster via the :program:`mongos` instances. If you connect "
"directly to a shard, you will see only its fraction of the cluster's data. "
"There is no particular order to the data set on a specific shard. MongoDB "
"does not guarantee that any two contiguous chunks will reside on a single "
"shard."
