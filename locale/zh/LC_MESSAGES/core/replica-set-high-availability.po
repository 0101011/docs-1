"MongoDB introduces a version 1 of the replication protocol "
"(:rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1 <protocolVersion>`) to reduce replica set "
"failover time and accelerates the detection of multiple simultaneous "
"primaries. New replica sets will, by default, use :rsconf:`protocolVersion: "
"1 <protocolVersion>`. Previous versions of MongoDB use version 0 of the "
"protocol. To upgrade existing replica sets to use :rsconf:`protocolVersion: "
"1 <protocolVersion>`, see :ref:`3.2-upgrade-replica-set`."
