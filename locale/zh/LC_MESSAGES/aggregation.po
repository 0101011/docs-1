"Aggregations operations process data records and return computed results. "
"Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and "
"can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single "
"result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the "
":doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the :doc:`map-"
"reduce function </core/map-reduce>`, and :doc:`single purpose aggregation "
"methods and commands </core/single-purpose-aggregation>`."

"The aggregation pipeline is a framework for performing aggregation tasks, "
"modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Using this framework, "
"MongoDB passes the documents of a single collection through a pipeline. The "
"pipeline transforms the documents into aggregated results, and is accessed "
"through the :dbcommand:`aggregate` database command."
