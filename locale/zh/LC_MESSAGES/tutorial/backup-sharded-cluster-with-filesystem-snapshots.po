"This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all components of"
" a sharded cluster. This procedure uses file system snapshots to capture a "
"copy of the :program:`mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses "
":program:`mongodump` to create binary database dumps when file-system "
"snapshots are not available. See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-"
"with-database-dumps` for the alternate procedure."

"In this procedure, you will stop the cluster balancer and take a backup up "

"cluster using a file-system snapshot tool. If you need an exact moment-in-"
"time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all application writes "

"approximate a moment in time."
