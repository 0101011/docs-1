"While :term:`replica sets <replica set>` provide basic protection against "
"single-instance failure, replica sets whose members are all located in a "
"single facility are susceptible to errors in that facility. Power outages, "
"network interruptions, and natural disasters are all issues that can affect "
"replica sets whose members are colocated. To protect against these classes "
"of failures, deploy a replica set with one or more members in a "
"geographically distinct facility or data center to provide redundancy."

msgid ""
"Ensure that a majority of the :ref:`voting members <replica-set-non-voting-"

":doc:`priority 0 members </core/replica-set-priority-0-member>` and "
":doc:`arbiters </core/replica-set-arbiter>`. Deploy other members in "

"For instance, for a three-member replica set you need two instances in a "

"For all configurations in this tutorial, deploy each replica set member on a"
