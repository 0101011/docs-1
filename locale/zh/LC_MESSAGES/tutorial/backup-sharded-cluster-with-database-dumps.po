"This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all components of"
" a sharded cluster. This procedure uses :program:`mongodump` to create dumps"
" of the :program:`mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses file system "
"snapshots to capture the backup data, and may be more efficient in some "
"situations if your system configuration allows file system backups. See "
":doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters` for more information."
