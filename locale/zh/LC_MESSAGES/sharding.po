"Sharding is the process of storing data records across multiple machines and"
" is MongoDB's approach to meeting the demands of data growth. As the size of"
" the data increases, a single machine may not be sufficient to store the "
"data nor provide an acceptable read and write throughput. Sharding solves "
"the problem with horizontal scaling. With sharding, you add more machines to"
" support data growth and the demands of read and write operations."
