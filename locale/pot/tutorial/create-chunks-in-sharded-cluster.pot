msgid "For example, if you want to ingest a large volume of data into a cluster that is unbalanced, or where the ingestion of data will lead to data imbalance, such as with monotonically increasing or decreasing shard keys. Pre-splitting the chunks of an empty sharded collection can help with the throughput in these cases."

msgid "Alternatively, starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, by defining the :doc:`zones and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` *before* sharding an empty or a non-existing collection, the shard collection operation creates chunks for the defined zone ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk distribution based on the zone ranges. For more information, see :ref:`initial-chunks-empty-collection`."
