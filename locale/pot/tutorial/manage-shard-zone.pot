msgid "In sharded clusters, you can create zones that represent a group of shards and associate one or more ranges of :term:`shard key` values to that zone. MongoDB routes reads and writes that fall into a zone range only to those shards inside of the zone."

msgid "By defining the zones and the zone ranges *before* sharding an empty or a non-existing collection, the shard collection operation creates chunks for the defined zone ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk distribution based on the zone ranges. This initial creation and distribution of chunks allows for faster setup of zoned sharding. After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk distribution going forward."
