The :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` command only supports the :ref:`storage-wiredtiger` storage engine."

msgid "Reducing the size of the oplog does *not* automatically reclaim the disk space allocated to the original oplog size. You must run :dbcommand:`compact` against the ``oplog.rs`` collection in the ``local`` database to reclaim disk space. There are no benefits to running ``compact`` on the ``oplog.rs`` collection after increasing the oplog size."

msgid "The replica set member cannot replicate oplog entries while the ``compact`` operation is ongoing. While ``compact`` runs, the member may fall so far behind the primary that it cannot resume replication. The likelihood of a member becoming \"stale\" during the ``compact`` procedure increases with cluster write throughput, and may be further exacerbated by the reduced oplog size."

#: ../source/tutorial/change-oplog-size.txt:94
