msgid "In sharded clusters, you can create :term:`zones <zone>` of sharded data based on the :term:`shard key`. You can associate each zone with one or more shards in the cluster. A shard can associate with any number of zones. In a balanced cluster, MongoDB migrates :term:`chunks <chunk>` covered by a zone only to those shards associated with the zone."

The ``B`` zone represents a range with a lower boundary of ``10`` and an upper boundary of ``20``. Shards ``Alpha`` and ``Beta`` have the ``A`` zone. Shard ``Beta`` also has the ``B`` zone. Shard ``Charlie`` has no zones associated with it. The cluster is in a steady state and no chunks violate any of the zones."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-pre-define-zone.rst:2
msgid "By defining the zones and the zone ranges *before* sharding an empty or a non-existing collection, the shard collection operation creates chunks for the defined zone ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk distribution based on the zone ranges. This initial creation and distribution of chunks allows for faster setup of zoned sharding. After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk distribution going forward."

msgid "For each :term:`chunk <chunk>` marked for migration, the balancer checks each possible destination shard for any configured zones. If the chunk range falls into a zone, the balancer migrates the chunk into a shard inside that zone. Chunks that do not fall into a zone can exist on *any* shard in the cluster and are migrated normally."

msgid "During balancing rounds, if the balancer detects that any chunks violate the configured zones for a given shard, the balancer migrates those chunks to a shard where no conflict exists."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/zone-sharding.txt:89
msgid "After associating a zone with a shard or shards and configuring the zone with a shard key range for a sharded collection, the cluster may take some time to migrate the affected data for the sharded collection. This depends on the division of chunks and the current distribution of data in the cluster. When balancing is complete, reads and writes for documents in a given zone are routed only to the shard or shards inside that zone."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/zone-sharding.txt:109
msgid "For example, given a shard key ``{ a : 1, b : 2, c : 3 }``, creating or updating a zone to cover values of ``b`` requires including ``a`` as the prefix. Creating or updating a zone to covers values of ``c`` requires including ``a`` and ``b`` as the prefix."

msgid "When using zones on a hashed shard key, each zone covers the *hashed* shard key values. Given a shard key ``{ a : 1 }`` and a zone ``alpha`` with a lower bound of ``1`` and an upper bound of ``5``, the bounds represent the *hashed* value of ``a``, and not the actual value. Therefore, there is no guarantee that MongoDB routes documents where ``a`` has a value of ``1`` to ``5`` to zone ``alpha``. MongoDB routes any document where the *hashed* shard key value falls within the range of ``1`` or ``5`` to a shard inside zone ``alpha``."
