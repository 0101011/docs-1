msgid "In the following diagram, the primary node was unavailable for longer than the :rsconf:`configured timeout <settings.electionTimeoutMillis>` and triggers the :ref:`automatic failover <replication-auto-failover>` process. One of the remaining secondaries calls for an election to select a new primary and automatically resume normal operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/replica-set-elections.txt:36
msgid "The replica set cannot process write operations until the election completes successfully. The replica set can continue to serve read queries if such queries are configured to :ref:`run on secondaries <replica-set-read-preference>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-election-latency.rst:1
msgid "The median time before a cluster elects a new primary should not typically exceed 12 seconds, assuming default :rsconf:`replica configuration settings <settings>`. This includes time required to mark the primary as :ref:`unavailable <replication-auto-failover>` and call and complete an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. You can tune this time period by modifying the :rsconf:`settings.electionTimeoutMillis` replication configuration option. Factors such as network latency may extend the time required for replica set elections to complete, which in turn affects the amount of time your cluster may operate without a primary. These factors are dependent on your particular cluster architecture."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/replica-set-elections.txt:78
msgid "After a replica set has a stable primary, the election algorithm will make a \"best-effort\" attempt to have the secondary with the highest :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` available call an election. Member priority affects both the timing and the outcome of elections; secondaries with higher priority call elections relatively sooner than secondaries with lower priority, and are also more likely to win. However, a lower priority instance can be elected as primary for brief periods, even if a higher priority secondary is available. Replica set members continue to call elections until the highest priority member available becomes primary."

When the primary detects that it can only see a minority of nodes in the replica set, the primary steps down as primary and becomes a secondary. Independently, a member in the partition that can communicate with a majority of the nodes (including itself) holds an election to become the new primary."
