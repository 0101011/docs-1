msgid ":binary:`~bin.mongo` is an interactive JavaScript shell interface to MongoDB, which provides a powerful interface for system administrators as well as a way for developers to test queries and operations directly with the database. :binary:`~bin.mongo` also provides a fully functional JavaScript environment for use with a MongoDB.
