MongoDB provides an automatic sharding facility that makes it possible
to distribute a single database across a cluster of machines. Sharding
uses range-based portioning to distribute :term:`documents` between
MongoDB instances based on a specific ":term:`shard key`. 

For a high level introduction to the underlying concepts and operation
of sharding, consider ":doc:`/core/sharding`." Once you understand how
sharding works and you decide to use sharding in your deployment, the
":doc:`/administration/sharding-architectures`" document provides an
overview of basic system architectures. 

Administrators of shard clusters should consider the
":doc:`/administration/sharding`" document which contains a catalog of
procedures for configuring and maintaining shard clusters, in addition
to a :ref:`troubleshooting <sharding-troubleshooting>` section to aid
in diagnosing common issues with sharding.

Finally, if you're interested in learning more about the internal
operation of sharding, the ":doc:`/core/sharding-internals`" document
provides a more in depth description of how MongoDB implements
sharding.
