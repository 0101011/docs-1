Aspirational MongoDB Documentation Contents
===========================================

The purpose of this documentation build is to hold and test stubs that
have not made it into the main documentation build because they are
too sparse, or would conflict with documentation that currently exists
in the :wiki:`MongoDB Wiki <Home>`.

This page is largely infrastructural and allows the manual to build.
