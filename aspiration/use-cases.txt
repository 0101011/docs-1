Use Cases
=========

The use case documents provide introductions to the patterns, design,
and operation used in application development with MongoDB. Each
document provides more concrete examples and implementation details to
support core MongoDB `use cases`_. These documents highlight
application design, and data modeling strategies (*i.e. schema
design*) for MongoDB with special attention to pragmatic
considerations including indexing, performance, sharding, and
scaling. Each document is distinct and can stand alone; however,

The *real time analytics* case studies describe applications that
collect machine generated data from logging systems, application
output, and other systems. The *E-commerce* case studies address
aspects of applications required for building product catalogs, and
managing inventory in e-commerce systems. The *content management*
case studies introduce basic patterns and techniques for building
content management systems using MongoDB.
