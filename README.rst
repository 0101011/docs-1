=====================

This repository contains the beginning of a major revision of the
MongoDB documentation. As of December 22, 2011, this documentation is
not published or finished and exists in a **very rough**
state. However, you can download and build locally if you already have
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ installed, with the following
command: ::

     git clone git://github.com/mongodb/docs
     cd docs/
     make html

Visit ``docs/mongodb/build/html/index.html`` to view the current state
of the documentation. You may also wish to install `Pygments
<http://pygments.org>`_ to provide syntax highlighting for code
examples.

github and issue a pull request. File issue reports or requests at the
`Documentation Jira Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCS>`_.
